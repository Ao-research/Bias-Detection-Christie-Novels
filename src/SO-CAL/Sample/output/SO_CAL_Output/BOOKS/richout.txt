A most astonishing disposition , one that seemed totally unlike anything Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe had ever done before . " 0

She would not let Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe do always what she liked . 1.0
It is true , is it not , that Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe in the letters you wrote for her , often asked you to copy her handwriting as nearly as you could ? 0

Possibly Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe had told her that some money would be left her because of her kindness , because of her attention , because of a fondness the old lady was beginning to feel for this girl who fulfilled all her whims , who did whatever she asked her . 3.5
There are people who will say that Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe often did not know what she was signing . 0
Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe , he gathered , had come here to live so as to be near to her nephew and his wife , and that the wife had readily undertaken the supervision and care of her husband 's aunt as far as she could do so without actually living in the house . 3.0

" And so I sees Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe pull herself up from the chair - she 'd got arthritis and had pain moving about sometimes - and go over to the bookcase " So I will admit that next day , when Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe had driven into Medchester and I was doing her bedroom as usual - a bed sitting room she had because she had to rest a lot . 1.0
So I put it back where it was because I should n't like Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe to know that I 'd been poking about in her things . 0
And I thought , fancy that foreign girl getting all that money because we all know as Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe was very rich . 4.1
" But when all the fuss came up about the Will , and there was talk of how it had been forged and Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe could never have written that codicil herself - for that 's what they were saying , mind you , as it was n't the old lady who had written that at all , it was somebody else - " " I see , " said Mrs Oliver . 0
You saw Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe write a codicil to her Will . 0
" So if you both saw Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe write her name , then that signature could n't have been a forgery , could it ? 0
What happened ? " 0
" Well , of course , the next day or a few days later , or even as much as a week later , Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe either had a bit of a tiff with her devoted au pair attendant , or she had a delicious reconciliation with her nephew , Hugo , or her niece , Rowena , and she tore up the Will or scratched out the codicil or something like that , or burnt the whole thing . " 7.0
" And after that ? " 0
" Well , after that , I suppose , Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe dies , and the girl seizes her chance and writes a new codicil in roughly the same terms in as near to Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe 's handwriting as she can , and the two witnessing signatures as near as she can . -4.0
It would have been better , perhaps , he thought suddenly , if Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe had not wanted this fairy - like transformation . 0
I do n't think Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe knew much about it . 0
" And where Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe died and her Will was to be admitted to probate , it was found the Will was forged . " -0.375
She wrote handwritten letters for Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe had been spoken of as " generous " . 2.0
Perhaps he believed at first he could influence Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe to dote upon him to the extent of making a Will in his favour - but Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe was not that kind of woman . " 1.0
" What about the forgery ? 0
" But what about the codicil that the cleaning woman witnessed ? " 0
" My surmise is that Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe discovered that Michael Garfield and Rowena Drake were having an affair - probably before her husband died . -0.30000000000000004

Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe was an elderly woman and a sick woman also . -4.5

" I do n't suppose she 'd have consulted me if she was worried , " said Miss Martindale . 0
I can see that it is not likely that Edna Brent would have confided any fears or worries to you , but she might have spoken of them to her fellow employees . " -1.5
" That 's possible enough , I expect , " said Miss Martindale . 1.0
" I expect you 'd like to speak to them alone , " said Miss Martindale . 0
The fair girl said : " I told Miss Martindale that she 'd been at the inquest with the rest of us , but that we had n't seen her afterwards and did n't know where she 'd gone . " 1.0
" That was true , was it ? " 0
asked Hardcastle . 0
But there is a third possibility -- she could have been referring to Miss Martindale . " 0
At 2:35 Miss Martindale 's buzzer went , and Edna Brent in the outer office answered it in her usual breathy and slightly nasal voice , as she manoeuvred a toffee along the line of her jaw . 0.25
" Yes , Miss Martindale ? " 0
" Now , Edna -- that is not the way I 've told you to speak when answering the telephone . 0
" Sorry , Miss Martindale . " 0
" That 's better . 0
" She 's not back from lunch yet , Miss Martindale . " 0
Miss Martindale 's eye consulted the clock on her desk . 0
Miss Martindale looked up from her desk . 0
Have you worked for her before ? " 0
" I ca n't remember doing so , Miss Martindale . 0
Miss Martindale glanced at the clock . 0
Miss Martindale 's door opened . 0
Can you remember that or shall I write it down ? " 0
" I can remember it , Miss Martindale . " 0
Miss Martindale went back into her sanctum . 0
So when I came back from lunch Miss Martindale told me to go . " 0
It was Miss Martindale she said it to -- that I was to come in and wait in the sitting room on the right of the hall . " 0
" I think she 's engaged at the moment on the telephone -- " At that moment there was a click and the girl picked up the telephone receiver and fiddled with a switch , and said : " Two gentlemen to see you , Miss Martindale . " 2.0
Miss Martindale looked up at us from a large desk behind which she was sitting . 0
Miss Martindale 's sandy eyebrows rose in surprise and a certain amount of displeasure . -2.0
What can I do for you , Inspector ? " 0
" I have come to you to ask for a little information , Miss Martindale . -1.5
I was rather doubtful myself whether Miss Martindale would be amenable to charm . -1.35
On the walls above Miss Martindale 's desk was hung a collection of signed photographs . 0
Miss Martindale switched off . 0
Here Miss Martindale got slightly restive . -1.5
" How was that appointment made , Miss Martindale ? " 0
" By telephone . 0
Miss Martindale looked a little surprised . -0.75
I thought that Miss Martindale would make an excellent witness . 0
" Well , you see , Miss Martindale , Miss Pebmarsh herself denies making any such call . " 0
Miss Martindale stared . 0
It seemed the kind of understatement characteristic of Miss Martindale . 0
" Does the name of Curry mean anything to you , Miss Martindale ? 0
Miss Martindale looked at him blankly . -1.5
In old days the public did n't really mind so much about accuracy , but nowadays readers take it upon themselves to write to authors on every possible occasion , pointing out flaws . " -5.5
Miss Martindale paused . 0
I could n't walk , had to take both shoes off and come back here with a couple of buns , and how I 'll ever get home or get on to the bus I really do n't know -- " At that moment our presence was noted and Edna hastily concealed the offending shoe with an apprehensive glance towards Miss Martindale whom I appreciated was not the sort of woman to approve of stiletto heels . -8.0
" Thank you , Miss Martindale , " said Hardcastle . 0
Miss Martindale , who also gave evidence , was questioned for an even shorter time . -0.375
That disposed of Miss Martindale . 0
" Miss Martindale is expecting you . " 0
Miss Martindale did not wait a moment before attacking him . -3.0
" I 'm sure , Miss Martindale , that -- " " Are you going to deny that two of my girls , two of them , have been victimized ? 0
" There 's nothing I want more than to get to the bottom of it , Miss Martindale . 0
" Give us time , Miss Martindale , " he said . 0
" I do n't think you need fear that , Miss Martindale . " 0
" As little as possible was mentioned this morning , Miss Martindale . -0.5
" Thank you , Miss Martindale . " 0
" Miss Martindale , I mean . " 0
Her eyes shot sideways to the door into Miss Martindale 's private office . 0
and I told the others and in the end we all said we 'd have to tell Miss Martindale about it , and just at that moment she came bouncing out of her office and said to us , ' Now what are you doing ? 0
We 've heard some terrible news about Edna , Miss Martindale . -6.0
'" " And what did Miss Martindale say or do ? " 0
" Well , she would n't believe it at first , " said the brunette . 0
She could write and say what had happened and ask him not to complain to Miss Martindale . 0.0
But Miss Martindale , in her private office , did not know that Edna had come back . 0
Miss Martindale must have made a mistake -- But Miss Martindale definitely does n't make mistakes . 0
Miss Martindale repeats her story of the telephone call and Edna knows definitely now that the evidence Miss Martindale gives so clearly , with such precision as to the exact time , is untrue . -3.0
I think probably that Miss Martindale , leaving the Cornmarket in a crowd of people , overheard her asking that . 0
Perhaps Miss Martindale speaks to her there , walks with her down the road and Edna plumps out her question . 0
Miss Martindale acts quickly . 1.0
She goes in , picks up the receiver and Miss Martindale comes in behind her , pulls the scarf round her neck and strangles her . " -3.0
But since Miss Martindale undoubtedly killed Edna -- oh , yes -- only she could have killed Edna , then she must come into it . 0
And I begin to suspect that in Miss Martindale we have the Lady Macbeth of this crime , a woman who is ruthless and unimaginative . " -9.0
" Unimaginative ? " 0
queried Hardcastle . 0
" You are taking it that Miss Martindale and Mrs. Bland are sisters ? " 0
" It is the only way things make sense . " 1.0
" I think you will find that Miss Martindale was responsible for them . 1.0
Did Miss Martindale take it as the foundation of her rigmarole , and was it partly because of that clock that she chose Sheila as the person to discover the body -- ? " 0
Hardcastle burst out : He did not live to write this one -- but Miss Martindale , who was his secretary , knew all about it . 0
Miss Martindale and Mrs. Bland are , as you conjectured , sisters , but though I agree with your views on her participation in these crimes , satisfactory evidence will be hard to obtain . -2.0
The Portobello Market people have identified Miss Martindale as the " American " lady who bought two of the clocks . 0

But think for a minute of this : What on earth was to tell the watching man that those sandwiches were going to be offered to Mary Gerrard ? 0
Not even Mary Gerrard , nor Nurse Hopkins . 0
" " Then what did you suggest , I 'd like to know ? 0
" " I asked you to tell the truth - not about the death , but about the life of Mary Gerrard . 0.125
I have here a warrant for your arrest upon the charge of murdering Mary Gerrard by administering poison to her on the 27th of July last , and I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down in writing and may be used as evidence at your trial . -4.5
He had been summoned by telephone to Hunterbury Hall ; too late for anything to be done ; Mary Gerrard had died a few minutes after his arrival ; death consistent , in his opinion , with morphia poisoning in one of its less common forms - the " foudroyante " variety . -3.55
" " During your visits to Hunterbury in June last , you had occasion to see the accused and Mary Gerrard together ? -1.0
" " What should you say was the manner of the accused to Mary Gerrard ? -0.75
" " Perfectly pleasant and natural . 5.4
Then he said , " You knew the dead girl , Mary Gerrard , intimately ? " 0.0
" Yes . " 0
" What was your opinion of her ? " 0
" She was a very sweet girl - and a good girl . 5.1
Or Mary Gerrard herself ? 0
" " I suppose so - yes . 0
" " Mary Gerrard knew you had it there , too ? 0
" " No , she did n't . 0
" Is it a fact that on Thursday , July 6th , the dead girl , Mary Gerrard , made a will ? " 0.0
" She did . " 0
" Why did she do that ? " 0
" Because she thought it was the proper thing to do . 1.0
Signed by Mary Gerrard , witnessed by Emily Biggs and Roger Wade , confectioners ' assistants , and leaving everything of which she died possessed to Mary Riley , sister of Eliza Riley ? 0
" " That 's right . 0.3333333333333333
" To your knowledge , had Mary Gerrard any property to leave ? " 0
" Not then , she had n't . " 0
" But surely , if she had hated Mary Gerrard , as is suggested , she would not of her own free will have handed over to her a large sum of money . -1.0
Now , had you heard any local gossip about Mary Gerrard and Mr Roderick Welman ? 0
" " He was sweet on her . 1.5
" Now , regarding the attitude of the accused to Mary Gerrard , there was no quarrel between them at any time ? -0.6000000000000001
There is the possibility that Mary Gerrard committed suicide . 0
I propose to show you that there was another person who had not only an equal opportunity to poison Mary Gerrard , but who had a far better motive for doing so . 2.0
I propose to call evidence to show you that there was another person who had access to the morphine , and who had a very good motive for killing Mary Gerrard , and I can show that that person had an equally good opportunity of doing so . 2.45
" " The engagement was not broken off on account of Mary Gerrard ? 0
" " I did think Roderick was rather taken with her , but I did n't believe it was anything serious . 0
" " Did you think she was trying to convey to you a message on the night of June 28th when she died ? 0
" " I understood that she had made no provision for Mary Gerrard , and was anxious to do so . -3.0
I then went down to the lodge and invited the District Nurse and Mary Gerrard to come up to the house . 0
" " Did you have any ? 0
" " No . 0
" " But Mary Gerrard and Nurse Hopkins both drank tea ? 0
" " Yes . 0
" " What happened next ? 0
" " Leaving you alone with Mary Gerrard ? 0
" " Yes . 0
" " What happened next ? 0
" " After a few minutes I picked up the tray and the sandwich plate and carried them into the pantry . 0
" " Where was Mary Gerrard ? 0
" " She was sitting in the morning - room . 0
" " Now , will you tell us just what your relations were with Mary Gerrard ? 0
" ( Oh , Roddy , poor Roddy , how you must hate all this ! ) " 0
" Did you go to see this girl Mary Gerrard in London on the 25th at her lodgings ? 0
And therefore Mary Gerrard at Mrs Welman 's death inherited a vast fortune . 3.75
A sum in the neighborhood of two hundred thousand pounds was inherited by Mary Gerrard . 0.5
" All that we do know is this : That at Nurse Hopkins 's instigation , Mary Gerrard made a will leaving everything she had to ' Mary Riley , sister of Eliza Riley . ' 0
You must be perfectly satisfied that this woman did , in fact , administer a dangerous dose of morphia to Mary Gerrard on July 27th . -4.5
" The Prosecution has stated that the only person who had the opportunity to administer poison to Mary Gerrard was the accused . -0.9166666666666667
There is the theory that Mary Gerrard committed suicide , but the only evidence in support of that theory is the fact that Mary Gerrard made a will shortly before she died . -0.21428571428571427
But Nurse Hopkins had mentioned casually that Mary Gerrard had rebuffed Roderick Welman 's advances both in Maidensford ' and again when she saw him in London . ' -4.0
Mary Gerrard , you informed me , went to London on July 10th - a day after Roderick Welman had left England . 1.0
When did Mary Gerrard have an interview with Roderick Welman in London ? 0
Nurse Hopkins knew something about Mary Gerrard which she was very anxious should come out . -1.7999999999999998
There could be only one answer to that if Nurse Hopkins was guilty : because the other murder , the murder of Mary Gerrard , was already planned , and a scapegoat had been selected , but that scapegoat must be shown to have had a chance of obtaining morphine . -8.75
What motive could there be for Nurse Hopkins to do away with Mary Gerrard ? 0
But the gist of the contents made it perfectly plain that Mary Gerrard was not to know the truth . -0.6333333333333337
It was not Mary Gerrard to whom that letter was written , but another Mary . 0
Hopkins had already made friends with Mary Gerrard and acquired a good deal of influence over the girl . 2.6
Once that was signed , Mary Gerrard was doomed . -3.0
She 'll forgive him the Mary Gerrard business . 1.0

Elinor Carlisle entered the grounds of Hunterbury by the back gate . 0
Then a shadow fell across the room , and the two women looked round to see Elinor Carlisle standing at the window . -1.5
This girl , Elinor Carlisle , had just come into a place near here - Hunterbury Hall - and a fortune from her aunt , who died intestate . 0.7
Elinor Carlisle put up the place for sale and a man called Somervell bought it . 0
" Elinor Carlisle was staying at the local pub . 0
And the police found a scrap of a label with morphia hydrochlor on it just where Elinor Carlisle had been spreading the sandwiches . 0.25
I presume that Elinor Carlisle handed the plate to Mary Gerrard first ? 0
Elinor Carlisle was to have telephoned the lawyer first thing in the morning . 0
" " So Elinor Carlisle knew that her aunt wanted to make a will ? 0
And if her aunt died without making one , Elinor Carlisle inherited everything ? 0
" Peter Lord said quickly , " She did n't know that . 0
Could Elinor Carlisle have taken the morphine from the attachE case ? 0
" " Yes . 0
Let us say that Elinor Carlisle did take that morphine from the attachE case and did administer it to her aunt . 0
" You told me when you came into this room that Elinor Carlisle had the bad taste to be in love with a long - nosed , supercilious ass . -1.5
Nobody touched those sandwiches except Elinor Carlisle . 0
Elinor Carlisle had a motive for killing Mary Gerrard , and she is , in your opinion , capable of killing Mary Gerrard , and in all probability she did kill Mary Gerrard . 2.0
Now we will dismiss all those considerations from our mind and we will approach the matter from the opposite angle : If Elinor Carlisle did not kill Mary Gerrard , who did ? -1.5
You said nobody but Elinor Carlisle touched those sandwiches . 0
There was a time during which Elinor Carlisle left the house to go down to the lodge . 0
Someone , not Elinor Carlisle , desired her death . -1.5
Elinor Carlisle was making that sum over to her because she believed her aunt would have wished it . 0
If Elinor Carlisle , or Roderick Welman , or Nurse O'Brien , or even any of the servants , were to open that case and abstract a little glass tube , what would anyone think ? 0
Elinor Carlisle . 0
And so we are back at the sandwiches and the empty house , and we have Elinor Carlisle once more - but this time with a different motive to save her neck . -3.0
It swings round , and when it comes to rest it points always at the same name - Elinor Carlisle . 0
" " Tell you what ? 0
" " Exactly what is in your mind - no matter how damaging it may happen to be to Elinor Carlisle . -6.0
( He added in his own mind , Except Elinor Carlisle . ) 0
Elinor Carlisle had reason to fear that she might be disinherited in favor of an outsider . 0

He paused and then said , " Has Elinor Carlisle any enemies ? " 0
" Has Elinor Carlisle made a will ? " 0
" Yes . " 0
" Recently ? 0
Elinor Carlisle might have helped her . 0
But Elinor Carlisle is a level - headed , clear - thinking kind of young woman . 3.0
We might say , perhaps , Did anyone hate Elinor Carlisle ? 0
" Slowly Dr Lord shook his head . 0
But , then , she is convinced that the crime was committed by Elinor Carlisle , and clearly this fact , whatever it is , has nothing to do with Elinor . -2.0
" Elinor Carlisle said , " Peter Lord ... " Her tone was reminiscent . " 1.0
Elinor Carlisle said coldly , " I did not kill her . 0
Elinor Carlisle was arrested because sufficient evidence was found to make out a case against her - a very strong case , I may say . 3.4
He said , " That 's the window of the pantry where Elinor Carlisle was cutting the sandwiches . 0
And that , my friend , is the difference between Elinor Carlisle and Roderick Welman . 2.0
That is to say , Elinor Carlisle . 0
No one knew that but Elinor Carlisle herself - nobody ! 0
He thought , he must have thought , that the sandwiches were to be eaten by Elinor Carlisle herself . 0
Elinor Carlisle could not be quite sure . 0
The Prosecution proposes that Elinor Carlisle , having obtained possession of morphine ( which everyone else in the house had had equal opportunity of purloining , and as to which there exists considerable doubt whether it was ever in the house at all ) , proceeds to poison Mary Gerrard . -1.2999999999999998
I submit to you that the engagement between Elinor Carlisle and Roderick Welman was entered into mainly to please old Mrs Welman . 0.5
Moreover , Elinor Carlisle , who had inherited her aunt 's fortune , in the kindliness of her nature , was planning to settle a considerable sum of money on Mary Gerrard . 2.0
" The only thing that there is against Elinor Carlisle is the circumstances under which the poisoning took place . " 0
The Prosecution has said in effect : " No one but Elinor Carlisle could have killed Mary Gerrard . " 0
Now , is it true that no one but Elinor Carlisle could have killed Mary Gerrard ? 0
There is the possibility that someone tampered with the sandwiches while Elinor Carlisle was out of the house at the lodge . -3.0
And I 'm not Elinor Carlisle ; I 'm ' the accused . ' -3.0
It is for you to say if Elinor Carlisle is to go forth free from the court . 3.0
If , after the evidence you have heard , you are satisfied that Elinor Carlisle poisoned Mary Gerrard , then it is your duty to pronounce her guilty . -2.5
" Looked at from that point of view , gentlemen of the jury , I submit to you that the case against Elinor Carlisle falls to the ground . 0
It has also been suggested that the morphine might have been introduced into the sandwiches by someone entering the pantry during the time that Elinor Carlisle was at the lodge . 0
In that case , the poison was intended for Elinor Carlisle , and Mary Gerrard 's death was a mistake . -4.5
" There had always been that period of time in my mind when the sandwiches were on a plate in the pantry and Elinor Carlisle was down at the lodge . " 0
He waited a minute and then went on : " A new life - that is what Elinor Carlisle is beginning now - and it is you who have given her that life . 2.0
Elinor Carlisle 's lips parted . 0
So far everything I have found out about the case points to Elinor Carlisle 's being guilty . -0.75
It lulled Elinor almost into unconsciousness . -1.5
Empty house ... " The words stabbed through the thick enveloping blanket of Elinor 's thoughts - pin - pricks through a heavy muffling veil ... - People ... People leaning forward , their lips parted a little , their eyes agog , staring at her , Elinor , with a horrible ghoulish enjoyment - listening with a kind of slow , cruel relish to what that tall man was saying about her . -16.25
From the very beginning ... " Elinor thought , The beginning ... Elinor was still staring at this missive , her plucked brows drawn together in distaste , when the door opened . " -3.0
Elinor shook her head . 0
Elinor said , " It 's rather horrid . -6.75
He said - a sharp , disgusted exclamation , " No ! " -7.0
Elinor said again , " It 's rather horrid ... " She moved a step toward her desk . -3.375
But on an impulse Elinor decided differently . 0
Elinor said , " One of the servants , do you think ? " 0
" I suppose so . " 0
" I wonder who - who the person is - the one they mention ? " 0
Elinor said thoughtfully , " It must be Mary Gerrard , I think . " 0
Elinor nodded . 0
Elinor said , " She 's turned out very nice - looking . " 2.4
Elinor said , " I suppose she is up at the house a good deal . " 3.0
Roddy said , " Why ca n't the nurse read to her ? " 0
Elinor said with a smile , " Nurse O'Brien 's got a brogue you can cut with a knife ! 0
Then he said , " You know , Elinor , I believe we ought to go down . " 0
Elinor said with a slight recoil , " Because of this - ? " 0
" No , no - not at all . 0
He said , " And the money does matter - to you and me , Elinor . 0
And - it 's a pretty large sum , Elinor . 1.0
" " Yes , " said Elinor thoughtfully . " 1.0
Elinor sighed . 0
If I 've been in a hole she 's helped me out ; luckily I have n't done that too often ! -4.0
" " She 's been awfully generous to me , too , " said Elinor gratefully . 3.4
But , you know , Elinor , perhaps without meaning to do so , you and I live pretty extravagantly , considering what our means really are ! 4.0
" Elinor said , " Do you think I ought to , Roddy ? 0
" He shook his head . " 0
Elinor said , " We sound rather like human leeches ! " -5.0
" Nonsense ! " 0
Elinor said thoughtfully , " Aunt Laura has never told us definitely just how she has left her money ? " 0
Roddy said , " That does n't matter ! 0
You do love me , do n't you , Elinor ? 0
" " Yes . 0
" " You 're adorable , Elinor . 5.0
" Elinor caught her breath . 0
You 're a fascinating creature , Elinor . 5.0
you may get tired of me , though , I 'm such an ordinary sort of chap - " Elinor shook her head . 0
Elinor said , " We 'd have gone if she 'd asked for us - at once . " 0
Elinor nodded . 0
" He lit a match and set fire to the letter which he took from Elinor 's hand . " 0
Elinor said , " Aunt Laura likes the new doctor who 's taken over Dr Ransome 's practice - but not to that extent ! 4.0
Her eyes - eyes still deep and blue like those of her niece Elinor , looked up at the ceiling . 0
Elinor has it , too . 0
I had an idea , long ago , when they were children , that Elinor had set her heart on Roddy . 0.25
Miss Elinor and Mr Roderick have arrived . 0
" Elinor smiled at her . " 1.0
The older woman said , after a moment 's hesitation , " You do - care about him , Elinor ? " 0
Elinor 's delicate brows lifted . 2.0
" Elinor said gravely , " I care for Roddy enough and not too much . 2.5
" Elinor said with feeling , " You know Roddy very well ! 2.4
" Mrs Welman said , " If Roddy cares for you just a little more than you care for him - well , that 's all to the good . 2.3333333333333335
" Elinor said sharply , " Aunt Agatha 's Advice Column . 0
" Elinor said with some slight bitterness , " I suppose it is . 0
" In the sense you mean , Elinor - no , probably not . 0
To care passionately for another human creature brings always more sorrow than joy ; but all the same , Elinor , one would not be without that experience . 6.166666666666666
The hand that Elinor extended to him he took rather gingerly as though he thought he might break it . 0
" He was still looking at Elinor with obvious admiration . 3.09
Elinor said , moving toward the door , " Perhaps I shall see you before you go , Dr Lord ? " 0
" Oh - er - yes , of course . 0
He wondered if he and Elinor would live at Hunterbury one day . 0
He was a little doubtful about Elinor . -1.875
A little difficult to know where you were with Elinor . -3.3
Elinor , he thought judicially , was really quite perfect . 6.5
It did honestly strike him as strange that Elinor should have consented to marry him . -3.0
He supposed that Elinor and he would be married quite soon - that is , if Elinor wanted to ; perhaps she 'd rather put it off for a bit . -1.5
But not with Elinor . 0
Elinor stood motionless a minute . 0
" Elinor said , " Yes - it 's a long time . 0
Elinor stood looking after her . 0
" Elinor did not answer . 0
Immediately on receipt of the telegram Elinor had rung up Roddy , and now they were in the train together bound for Hunterbury . 0
Elinor had not seen much of Roddy in the week that had elapsed since their visit . 0
A little , Elinor thought , as though he were playing a part in a play - the part of the devoted fiancE . -0.25
Then she had said to herself , Do n't be an idiot . -4.5
" Elinor said , " I do mind so terribly for her . -10.5
" Elinor said thoughtfully , " It would be in the doctors ' hands , of course . 2.0
Elinor exclaimed as she came into the drawing - room , " Is she very bad ? " 0.0
Roddy was looking pale and apprehensive . -4.5
Dr Lord and Elinor went upstairs . 0
Elinor stood looking down on her , shocked by the drawn , twisted face . -3.0
A faint change came over her face as she recognized Elinor . -1.5
" Elinor ... " Elinor said quickly , " I 'm here , Aunt Laura . 0.25
Elinor guessed at the meaning . 0
Dr Lord and Elinor frowned helplessly . -6.0
Then Elinor got a word . 0
Elinor took her hand in hers and felt a feeble pressure from her fingers . -4.5
Dr Lord laid a hand on Elinor 's arm and drew her gently away out of the room . 1.0
Elinor had turned her head to look after Mary . 0
The color rose in Elinor 's cheeks . -3.0
Elinor said , " Poor darling . " 0
Elinor said , her lips set very straight , " I 've learned not - to show my feelings . 0
Elinor said , raising her delicate eyebrows and looking full at him , " The mask ? " 1.0
Dr Lord said , " The human face is , after all , nothing more nor less than a mask . 0.6666666666666666
Elinor said , " Poor darling . 0
He looked at her , Elinor thought , rather oddly as though - as though he was sorry for her . -5.85
Elinor said , " Aunt Laura is worried about - about certain business matters . " 0
Roddy asked , " Does she want to make a new will ? " 0.0
Elinor answered , " She did n't say so . " 0
" What did she - ? " 0
He stopped in the middle of the question . 0
Elinor said in a harsh voice , " Yes ? 0
Elinor 's hands closed . 0
" Roddy said in alarm , " And have dinner with me ? 0
" Elinor said coldly , " They wo n't bite you ! 0.0
" " But what about you ? 0
" Elinor said , " No , the other way 's better . 0
" She said impatiently , " Oh , do let me arrange things my own way ! 0
" Chapter 4 It was no mere housemaid who wakened Elinor the following morning . " 0.0
Oh , Miss Elinor , she 's gone . 0
" " What ? 0
" Elinor sat up in bed . 0
Dead ? 0
" Elinor stared . " 0
Elinor said slowly , " So Aunt Laura died in her sleep - quite peacefully . " 2.5500000000000003
Elinor said rather sharply , " It was n't exactly sudden . " 0
Elinor said mechanically , " I did n't know you 'd seen her ? " 0
He nodded rather shamefacedly . 0
" The truth is , Elinor , I felt the most awful coward , because I 'd funked it ! " -7.0
Elinor nodded . 0
" Elinor said in a low voice , " Yes , it is . 0
" Elinor said , " But surely , after her first stroke - ? 0
" Mr Seddon shook his head . " 0
Elinor said in a puzzled voice , " But she wanted to die . " 0
Elinor said slowly , " So that 's why she was so upset last night - and in such a panic that you should be sent for . " 1.1999999999999993
Elinor said slowly , " All to me ? " 0
" The Crown takes a certain percentage , " Mr Seddon explained . 0
" Elinor said , " But Roderick - " Mr Seddon said with a little apologetic cough , " Mr Welman is only Mrs Welman 's husband 's nephew . 0.0
Elinor said slowly , " Of course , it does n't much matter which of us gets it , as we 're going to be married . -0.75
Elinor said . 0
For heaven 's sake , Elinor , do n't get it into your head that I grudge it to you . 0.0
Elinor said , her voice slightly unsteady , " We did agree , Roddy , in London that it would n't matter which of us it was , as - as we were going to be married ? " 0
He did n't answer . 0
Elinor said with a sudden gallant lift of the head , " It does n't matter - if we 're going to be married ... He went on : " Of course , Elinor , if you 've other ideas now - " Elinor cried out , " Oh , Roddy , ca n't you be honest ? 3.0
" Elinor said in a stifled voice , " I do . 0
" Elinor , her face white , said , " It 's not that . 0
" Elinor said , her mouth twisting sideways in a crooked smile , " It was n't difficult . 0.0
" Oh , Elinor - I do n't know what 's the matter ! " 0
Elinor said , " Yes , I can . 0
Oh , Elinor , what a cad I am , talking like this to you - " Elinor said , " Nonsense . 0
I 'm so terribly fond of you , Elinor ! 7.2
" Elinor said gently , " Love - is n't very reasonable . -4.199999999999999
" Roddy said miserably , " No . 0
" Elinor said , and her voice trembled a little , " Have you said anything to her ? 0.0
" Roddy said , " This morning - like a fool - I lost my head - " Elinor said , " Yes ? 0
" Roddy said , " Of course she shut me up at once ! 0
Taking it , he murmured without looking at her , " Elinor , you 've no idea what a beast I feel . " -1.5
Elinor said in her calm voice , " Do you think she 'll marry you ? " 0
He shook his head . 0
" Elinor said , " I think you 're right . 1.0
" You know , Elinor , I do love you - just as much as ever ! " 7.0
Elinor said , " If Mary was n't there - " Roddy said with sudden feeling , " Sometimes I wish she was n't ... You and I , Elinor , belong . " 0
You wanted to see me , Miss Elinor ? 0
" she said . 0
Elinor looked up . 0
Elinor held one hand shielding her face a little . -0.16666666666666666
" Elinor went on , her voice cold and detached : " My aunt , if she had had time to make a will , would have wished , I know , to leave several legacies . -1.5
Elinor said , " Though it was difficult for my aunt to speak coherently , she was able to make her meaning understood that last evening . " 3.0
Elinor said brusquely , " As soon as probate is granted , I am arranging that two thousand pounds should be made over to you - that sum to be yours to do with absolutely as you please . 0
Oh , Miss Elinor , that is good of you ! 2.0
" Elinor said sharply , " It is n't particularly good of me , and please do n't say anything . -0.14999999999999947
Elinor said , " I 'm glad . " 2.0
Elinor said , " That sounds a very good idea . " 0.72
" You 're very , very good , Miss Elinor , " said Mary gratefully . 2.6
Elinor said curtly , " It was Aunt Laura 's wish . " -1.5
She got up , said quietly , " Thank you very much , Miss Elinor , " and left the room . 1.0
Elinor sat quite still , staring ahead of her . 0
Elinor went at last in search of Roddy . 0
He turned sharply as Elinor came in . -0.5
You 've always got excellent judgment , Elinor . 5.0
Elinor held her breath for a minute , then she began to speak with nervous haste , the words tumbling out incoherently : " There 's something more . -1.5
He said , " My God , Elinor , do you want to make me feel an utter cad ? 0
Elinor cried out , " Roddy ! " 0
" Elinor said gently , " Poor Roddy . 2.0
Elinor drew herself up ; she flung back her head . 0
" Of course , Elinor . " 0
" And what is your advice ? " 0
Elinor said calmly , " You are not particularly tied ? " 0
Elinor , you 're wonderful ! 10.0
Oh , Elinor , my dear , you do n't know how truly fond I am of you . 4.3
" " Miss Elinor said that the night Mrs Welman died she told her to do something for me . -0.5
Elinor said , " What are you doing so busily ? 0
Suddenly Elinor laughed a strange laugh - almost hysterical . 0.25
What 's come to her ? 0
" Elinor had not taken more than half a dozen steps - she was still laughing - when a hand fell on her arm from behind . 1.0
He said peremptorily , " What were you laughing at ? " 0
Elinor said , " Really - I do n't know . 0
Elinor flushed . 0
That made me laugh ; I do n't know why ! 0.6666666666666666
" Lord said abruptly , " Do n't you ? 0
" Elinor said , " It was silly of me - I tell you - I 'm nervous . -2.25
" Elinor said incisively , " How useful ! 2.0
" He grinned disarmingly . 0
Elinor said , " There 's nothing the matter with me . " 0
Elinor said , " I 've had a certain amount of nervous strain I suppose . " -3.5
He said , " I expect you 've had quite a lot . " 0
Elinor shook her head . 0
" Elinor said , " I must be getting home now . 0
Elinor said impatiently , " It just struck me as funny , that was all ! " -3.0
" That Mary Gerrard was making a will ? 0
Elinor said impatiently , " Of course - everyone should make a will . " -3.0
Elinor said with feeling , " Yes , indeed . 0
Have you ? 0
" Elinor stared at him for a minute , then she laughed . " 0.5
In the library Elinor had just finished a letter : Dear Mr Seddon , Will you draft a will for me to sign ? 1.0
" Elinor said , " Do you mind its being sold ? 0
" " Oh , no , no ! 0
Elinor picked up her letter , glanced through it to see if it was all right . 0.5
Miss Elinor writes me that the house is sold and that she would like the lodge cleared out as soon as possible . 0
" Elinor shook her head . 0
And the cooking , they say , is fair , but it 's hardly what you 're accustomed to , Miss Elinor . -2.0
" Elinor said , smiling , " I 'm really quite comfortable . 2.6
" Elinor said , " I 'm glad someone has bought the house who really wants to live in it . 1.0
" Elinor said , " Yes , but , you see , it would have been a very large house for me to live in - alone . 0
Elinor said quickly , " I meant to ask you : Is there any special piece of furniture that you might care to have ? 0.3333333333333333
She said graciously , " Well , Miss Elinor , that is very thoughtful of you - very kind , I 'm sure . 7.3
If it 's not taking a liberty - " She paused and Elinor said , " Oh , no . 0
" " I have always had a great admiration for the secretaire in the drawing - room . 2.25
" Elinor remembered it , a somewhat flamboyant piece of inlaid marquetry . -1.0499999999999998
Anything else ? 0
" " No , indeed , Miss Elinor . 0
" Elinor said , " There are some chairs in the same style as the secretaire . 0
Is there anything I can do for you up at the house , Miss Elinor ? 0
" Elinor spoke quickly , rather abruptly . " 0.5
Elinor said , " Thank you , Mrs Bishop , but I would rather tackle it alone . " -3.0
Elinor nodded . 0
" Elinor said , " Well , I must be getting on now . 0
Elinor said with a faint smile , " In spite of their names , I always think they taste much alike . " -4.25
Elinor said , " One used to be rather afraid of eating fish pastes . " 0
Elinor said , " I 'll have one of salmon and anchovy and one of salmon and shrimp . 0
Elinor passed by a row of them . 0
" Elinor said , " Thank you , Horlick . 0
" As she moved on , the young man said nervously , his Adam 's apple jerking up and down in spasmodic fashion , " Excuse me , miss - " Elinor turned back . " -1.0
Elinor said quickly , " Of course I will do all I can for you , Horlick . 0
Elinor said kindly , " I hope Major Somervell will take you on . " 2.0
Elinor walked on . -0.15000000000000002
Little words and phrases : " Some day , Elinor , you may like to cut down those yews . 0
It had lain , perhaps , behind his feeling for her , Elinor . 0
Elinor said , " Good morning . " 0
Elinor said , " I 've been making some sandwiches . 0
Elinor had left the front door open . 0
Elinor looked at her sharply . -0.75
" Elinor said in a low voice , " That 's queer . 0
" Elinor smiled . 0.5
Elinor went across the hall and brought back from the pantry a big plate of sandwiches . 1.0
Elinor took a sandwich herself . 0
" Elinor said absently , " There 's a little tea still in the canister in the pantry . -0.13636363636363635
No milk , I suppose ? 0
" Elinor said , " Yes , I brought some . 0
" " Well , then , that 's all right , " said Nurse Hopkins and hurried out . 0.3333333333333333
Elinor and Mary were alone together . 0
Elinor , with an obvious effort , tried to make conversation . -3.0
I - I 'm very grateful to you - " A sudden harsh sound broke from Elinor . 0.8999999999999999
Elinor said , " You need n't be so grateful ! " -3.6000000000000005
Mary , rather embarrassed , said , " I did n't mean - that is - " She stopped . 0
Elinor was staring at her - a glance so searching , so , yes , strange that Mary flinched under it . -1.0
" Elinor got up quickly . 1.0
Elinor was taken with a sudden fit of laughter . 1.0
" Elinor said , " When we were children . 0
Elinor said in a cold , steel - like voice , " What must n't I think ? " 0
Mary murmured , " I - I 've forgotten what I was going to say . " 0
Elinor 's body relaxed - as at a danger past . -3.0
She put the tray in front of Elinor . 0
Elinor shook her head . 0
" Elinor got up and moved over to the window . " 0
Elinor murmured , " No , thank you . 2.0
Elinor wheeled round from the window . 0
Elinor moved at last . 0
" Oh , Miss Elinor , let me . " 0
Elinor said sharply , " No , you stay here . 0
She looked up sharply as Elinor entered . -1.5
Elinor answered mechanically , " Yes , the pantry faces south . " 0
Elinor said , " Oh , I 'm all right . 0.25
Elinor said idly , looking at her wrist , " You 've pricked yourself . -1.5
Memory poured in waves over Elinor . 0
Elinor picked up an empty fish - paste pot from the table and put it into the basin . -1.0
" She and Elinor cleared up the pantry . 0
The latter , Elinor explained , she thought of giving to Mrs Bishop . 0
She wondered if Elinor had found that photograph signed Lewis , and what she had made of it , if so . 0
She helped Elinor sort through the clothing and volunteered to tie them up in separate bundles for the different families and see to their distribution herself . 0.5
" Elinor said , " I left her in the morning - room . 0
Elinor followed her . 0
She turned on Elinor . 0
There was something menacing in her voice as she said , " What 's all this ? " 0
Elinor said , " I do n't know what you mean . " 0
Elinor said , " What 's the matter ? " 0
" The matter ? " 0
Elinor recoiled a step . -3.0
" Her eyes , hard with suspicion , glared at Elinor . -4.5
Elinor came down to clear out her aunt 's personal possessions and so on . 0
Elinor refused - rather overvehemently . -3.0
He 'll put forward the theory that the engagement between Elinor and Roderick was a family business , entered into for family reasons , to please Mrs Welman , and that the moment the old lady was dead Elinor broke it off of her own accord . -4.25
I think he almost believes it ! 0
" " Believes that Elinor did not care for him to any great extent ? 0
" " Yes . 0
" " In which case , " said Poirot , " she would have no reason for murdering Mary Gerrard . 0
She told him down here he had no business to speak like that to her when he was engaged to Miss Elinor . 2.0
The engagement between Miss Elinor and Mr Roderick was a great relief to her . 3.0
Miss Elinor has always been devoted to Mr Roddy - always was , as a tiny tot - quite beautiful to see . 5.9
Miss Elinor has a very loyal and devoted nature ! 4.8
And Miss Elinor , a nice - minded young lady as she is , of course she would n't realize what was going on . 1.3333333333333333
" Is it likely that a well - bred , nicely brought - up young lady like Miss Elinor would go about poisoning anyone ? " 0.0
Miss Elinor 's a young lady of feelings . 0.2
Oh , well , Miss Elinor was always a very proud and reserved young lady . 1.3666666666666667
He said slowly , " Miss Elinor 's a lady . -1.5
Miss Elinor - a nice quiet young lady like that - " Poirot said , " But Mary Gerrard died - and she did not die a natural death . 2.5595238095238093
Elinor and I had not even met him until we went down there this June . 0
Elinor 's an exquisite creature - beautifully poised and balanced - no violence in her nature . 9.0
Elinor 's telegram followed me about from place to place . 0
That Elinor killed Aunt Laura ? 0
" Roddy said doubtfully , " Elinor Elinor said how terribly sorry she was for her , how the poor dear hated being ill , and that now she would be more helpless still and that it would be absolute hell for her . -5.1499999999999995
Elinor said , ' One does feel that people ought to be set free if they themselves really want it . ' 0.0
So , when her aunt in her halting speech was asking for a lawyer , Elinor took no chances , and saw to it that the old lady should die that night ! -1.0
Elinor was the next of kin . 0
" Lord said , " But he was going to marry Elinor ! 0
" Poirot said , " True . 0
" Elinor said , " I shall be glad when it is - over . 0.6666666666666666
To read it over ? 0
" Elinor said , staring at him , " I read it over - yes , I had gone to look for some stamps . 0
" Elinor shrugged her shoulders . " 0
Elinor said in a low , suffocated voice , " He knew - he looked at me and he knew - " Poirot said , " Dr Lord knows a good deal . " 0.42857142857142855
Elinor said in a low voice , " Is it true that he sent you to - help me ? " 0
" It is true , Mademoiselle . " 0
Elinor , her chin raised defiantly , said , " I bought some paste for sandwiches . 0
What next ? 0
" Elinor said , " I came down to the pantry and I cut sandwiches . 0
" Elinor said nothing . " 0
Elinor said , " I put the sandwiches ready on a plate and I went down to the lodge . " 1.0
Elinor said dreamily , " There was a mark on Nurse 's wrist . " 0
" Something to prove Elinor 's innocence ? " 2.0
" Ah , I did not say that . 0
I saw Miss Elinor that morning and talked to her . 0
All the same , Elinor thought , Nurse Hopkins was not so frightening as Inspector Brill . 0.0
Elinor 's suggestion that everything be washed up , and her further suggestion that Nurse Hopkins should come upstairs with her and assist in sorting out clothes . 1.0
Elinor thought . 0
" Elinor thought , How queer . 0
Elinor thought , Why do they wrangle about it ? 0
Elinor frowned , suddenly jerked back to reality . -0.75
" Elinor was brought back into the court . 0
But Elinor shook her head . 0
" Elinor said , " Did you know I had n't done it , or were n't you sure ? 0.0
" Peter said simply , " I was never quite sure . -4.35
" Elinor said , " That 's why I nearly said ' guilty ' right at the beginning - because , you see , I had thought of it ... " Elinor said , " Yes , that 's true . 0.2
If you think murder long enough , you suddenly come through the blackness and feel that it 's all rather silly ! -5.35
" Elinor cried , " Oh ! 0
" Elinor said , and there were suddenly tears in her eyes , " Every now and then - in court - I looked at you . 0
But all along I realized that in that case Elinor must have been the intended victim , not Mary . 0
The anonymous letter written to Elinor . 0
That was to create bad feeling between Elinor and Mary . 0.5
The idea doubtless was that Elinor would come down and object to Mary 's influence over Mrs Welman . -1.5
Here was a perfect motive for the scapegoat , Elinor . -0.5
She may have meant to get Elinor to her cottage , but when Elinor came down to the lodge and asked them both to come up and have sandwiches she realized at once that a perfect opportunity had arisen . 2.166666666666667
The circumstances were such that Elinor was practically certain to be convicted . 0

Are you guilty or not guilty ? 0
" Elinor Carlisle stood very straight , her head raised . 0
Elinor Carlisle stood looking down at it as it lay open in her hand . 0
She looked up to see Elinor Carlisle standing outside the window looking in . 0
Yours sincerely , Elinor Carlisle . 0
" Letter from Dr Lord to Miss Elinor Carlisle . " 0
Letter from Elinor Carlisle to Mary Gerrard . 0
Yours very sincerely , Elinor Carlisle . 0
" Chapter 7 Elinor Carlisle came out of the King 's Arms on the morning of Thursday , July 27th , and stood for a minute or two looking up and down the main street of Maidensford . " 0
Elinor Carlisle entered the grounds of Hunterbury by the back gate . 0
Then a shadow fell across the room , and the two women looked round to see Elinor Carlisle standing at the window . -1.5
This girl , Elinor Carlisle , had just come into a place near here - Hunterbury Hall - and a fortune from her aunt , who died intestate . 0.7
Elinor Carlisle put up the place for sale and a man called Somervell bought it . 0
" Elinor Carlisle was staying at the local pub . 0
And the police found a scrap of a label with morphia hydrochlor on it just where Elinor Carlisle had been spreading the sandwiches . 0.25
I presume that Elinor Carlisle handed the plate to Mary Gerrard first ? 0
Elinor Carlisle was to have telephoned the lawyer first thing in the morning . 0
" " So Elinor Carlisle knew that her aunt wanted to make a will ? 0
And if her aunt died without making one , Elinor Carlisle inherited everything ? 0
" Peter Lord said quickly , " She did n't know that . 0
Could Elinor Carlisle have taken the morphine from the attachE case ? 0
" " Yes . 0
Let us say that Elinor Carlisle did take that morphine from the attachE case and did administer it to her aunt . 0
" You told me when you came into this room that Elinor Carlisle had the bad taste to be in love with a long - nosed , supercilious ass . -1.5
Nobody touched those sandwiches except Elinor Carlisle . 0
Elinor Carlisle had a motive for killing Mary Gerrard , and she is , in your opinion , capable of killing Mary Gerrard , and in all probability she did kill Mary Gerrard . 2.0
Now we will dismiss all those considerations from our mind and we will approach the matter from the opposite angle : If Elinor Carlisle did not kill Mary Gerrard , who did ? -1.5
You said nobody but Elinor Carlisle touched those sandwiches . 0
There was a time during which Elinor Carlisle left the house to go down to the lodge . 0
Someone , not Elinor Carlisle , desired her death . -1.5
Elinor Carlisle was making that sum over to her because she believed her aunt would have wished it . 0
If Elinor Carlisle , or Roderick Welman , or Nurse O'Brien , or even any of the servants , were to open that case and abstract a little glass tube , what would anyone think ? 0
Elinor Carlisle . 0
And so we are back at the sandwiches and the empty house , and we have Elinor Carlisle once more - but this time with a different motive to save her neck . -3.0
It swings round , and when it comes to rest it points always at the same name - Elinor Carlisle . 0
" " Tell you what ? 0
" " Exactly what is in your mind - no matter how damaging it may happen to be to Elinor Carlisle . -6.0
( He added in his own mind , Except Elinor Carlisle . ) 0
Elinor Carlisle had reason to fear that she might be disinherited in favor of an outsider . 0
You must admit that Elinor Carlisle had the best opportunity to do so ? 5.0
" " What about the nurses ? 0
" " Either of them could have done so , certainly . 0
One was Elinor Carlisle . 0
He paused and then said , " Has Elinor Carlisle any enemies ? " 0
" Has Elinor Carlisle made a will ? " 0
" Yes . " 0
" Recently ? 0
Elinor Carlisle might have helped her . 0
But Elinor Carlisle is a level - headed , clear - thinking kind of young woman . 3.0
We might say , perhaps , Did anyone hate Elinor Carlisle ? 0
" Slowly Dr Lord shook his head . 0
But , then , she is convinced that the crime was committed by Elinor Carlisle , and clearly this fact , whatever it is , has nothing to do with Elinor . -2.0
" Elinor Carlisle said , " Peter Lord ... " Her tone was reminiscent . " 1.0
Elinor Carlisle said coldly , " I did not kill her . 0
Elinor Carlisle was arrested because sufficient evidence was found to make out a case against her - a very strong case , I may say . 3.4
He said , " That 's the window of the pantry where Elinor Carlisle was cutting the sandwiches . 0
And that , my friend , is the difference between Elinor Carlisle and Roderick Welman . 2.0
That is to say , Elinor Carlisle . 0
No one knew that but Elinor Carlisle herself - nobody ! 0
He thought , he must have thought , that the sandwiches were to be eaten by Elinor Carlisle herself . 0
Elinor Carlisle could not be quite sure . 0
The Prosecution proposes that Elinor Carlisle , having obtained possession of morphine ( which everyone else in the house had had equal opportunity of purloining , and as to which there exists considerable doubt whether it was ever in the house at all ) , proceeds to poison Mary Gerrard . -1.2999999999999998
I submit to you that the engagement between Elinor Carlisle and Roderick Welman was entered into mainly to please old Mrs Welman . 0.5
Moreover , Elinor Carlisle , who had inherited her aunt 's fortune , in the kindliness of her nature , was planning to settle a considerable sum of money on Mary Gerrard . 2.0
" The only thing that there is against Elinor Carlisle is the circumstances under which the poisoning took place . " 0
The Prosecution has said in effect : " No one but Elinor Carlisle could have killed Mary Gerrard . " 0
Now , is it true that no one but Elinor Carlisle could have killed Mary Gerrard ? 0
There is the possibility that someone tampered with the sandwiches while Elinor Carlisle was out of the house at the lodge . -3.0
And I 'm not Elinor Carlisle ; I 'm ' the accused . ' -3.0
It is for you to say if Elinor Carlisle is to go forth free from the court . 3.0
If , after the evidence you have heard , you are satisfied that Elinor Carlisle poisoned Mary Gerrard , then it is your duty to pronounce her guilty . -2.5
" Looked at from that point of view , gentlemen of the jury , I submit to you that the case against Elinor Carlisle falls to the ground . 0
It has also been suggested that the morphine might have been introduced into the sandwiches by someone entering the pantry during the time that Elinor Carlisle was at the lodge . 0
In that case , the poison was intended for Elinor Carlisle , and Mary Gerrard 's death was a mistake . -4.5
" There had always been that period of time in my mind when the sandwiches were on a plate in the pantry and Elinor Carlisle was down at the lodge . " 0
He waited a minute and then went on : " A new life - that is what Elinor Carlisle is beginning now - and it is you who have given her that life . 2.0
Elinor Carlisle 's lips parted . 0
So far everything I have found out about the case points to Elinor Carlisle 's being guilty . -0.75
It lulled Elinor almost into unconsciousness . -1.5
Empty house ... " The words stabbed through the thick enveloping blanket of Elinor 's thoughts - pin - pricks through a heavy muffling veil ... - People ... People leaning forward , their lips parted a little , their eyes agog , staring at her , Elinor , with a horrible ghoulish enjoyment - listening with a kind of slow , cruel relish to what that tall man was saying about her . -16.25
From the very beginning ... " Elinor thought , The beginning ... Elinor was still staring at this missive , her plucked brows drawn together in distaste , when the door opened . " -3.0
Elinor shook her head . 0
Elinor said , " It 's rather horrid . -6.75
He said - a sharp , disgusted exclamation , " No ! " -7.0
Elinor said again , " It 's rather horrid ... " She moved a step toward her desk . -3.375
But on an impulse Elinor decided differently . 0
Elinor said , " One of the servants , do you think ? " 0
" I suppose so . " 0
" I wonder who - who the person is - the one they mention ? " 0
Elinor said thoughtfully , " It must be Mary Gerrard , I think . " 0
Elinor nodded . 0
Elinor said , " She 's turned out very nice - looking . " 2.4
Elinor said , " I suppose she is up at the house a good deal . " 3.0
Roddy said , " Why ca n't the nurse read to her ? " 0
Elinor said with a smile , " Nurse O'Brien 's got a brogue you can cut with a knife ! 0
Then he said , " You know , Elinor , I believe we ought to go down . " 0
Elinor said with a slight recoil , " Because of this - ? " 0
" No , no - not at all . 0
He said , " And the money does matter - to you and me , Elinor . 0
And - it 's a pretty large sum , Elinor . 1.0
" " Yes , " said Elinor thoughtfully . " 1.0
Elinor sighed . 0
If I 've been in a hole she 's helped me out ; luckily I have n't done that too often ! -4.0
" " She 's been awfully generous to me , too , " said Elinor gratefully . 3.4
But , you know , Elinor , perhaps without meaning to do so , you and I live pretty extravagantly , considering what our means really are ! 4.0
" Elinor said , " Do you think I ought to , Roddy ? 0
" He shook his head . " 0
Elinor said , " We sound rather like human leeches ! " -5.0
" Nonsense ! " 0
Elinor said thoughtfully , " Aunt Laura has never told us definitely just how she has left her money ? " 0
Roddy said , " That does n't matter ! 0
You do love me , do n't you , Elinor ? 0
" " Yes . 0
" " You 're adorable , Elinor . 5.0
" Elinor caught her breath . 0
You 're a fascinating creature , Elinor . 5.0
you may get tired of me , though , I 'm such an ordinary sort of chap - " Elinor shook her head . 0
Elinor said , " We 'd have gone if she 'd asked for us - at once . " 0
Elinor nodded . 0
" He lit a match and set fire to the letter which he took from Elinor 's hand . " 0
Elinor said , " Aunt Laura likes the new doctor who 's taken over Dr Ransome 's practice - but not to that extent ! 4.0
Her eyes - eyes still deep and blue like those of her niece Elinor , looked up at the ceiling . 0
Elinor has it , too . 0
I had an idea , long ago , when they were children , that Elinor had set her heart on Roddy . 0.25
Miss Elinor and Mr Roderick have arrived . 0
" Elinor smiled at her . " 1.0
The older woman said , after a moment 's hesitation , " You do - care about him , Elinor ? " 0
Elinor 's delicate brows lifted . 2.0
" Elinor said gravely , " I care for Roddy enough and not too much . 2.5
" Elinor said with feeling , " You know Roddy very well ! 2.4
" Mrs Welman said , " If Roddy cares for you just a little more than you care for him - well , that 's all to the good . 2.3333333333333335
" Elinor said sharply , " Aunt Agatha 's Advice Column . 0
" Elinor said with some slight bitterness , " I suppose it is . 0
" In the sense you mean , Elinor - no , probably not . 0
To care passionately for another human creature brings always more sorrow than joy ; but all the same , Elinor , one would not be without that experience . 6.166666666666666
The hand that Elinor extended to him he took rather gingerly as though he thought he might break it . 0
" He was still looking at Elinor with obvious admiration . 3.09
Elinor said , moving toward the door , " Perhaps I shall see you before you go , Dr Lord ? " 0
" Oh - er - yes , of course . 0
He wondered if he and Elinor would live at Hunterbury one day . 0
He was a little doubtful about Elinor . -1.875
A little difficult to know where you were with Elinor . -3.3
Elinor , he thought judicially , was really quite perfect . 6.5
It did honestly strike him as strange that Elinor should have consented to marry him . -3.0
He supposed that Elinor and he would be married quite soon - that is , if Elinor wanted to ; perhaps she 'd rather put it off for a bit . -1.5
But not with Elinor . 0
Elinor stood motionless a minute . 0
" Elinor said , " Yes - it 's a long time . 0
Elinor stood looking after her . 0
" Elinor did not answer . 0
Immediately on receipt of the telegram Elinor had rung up Roddy , and now they were in the train together bound for Hunterbury . 0
Elinor had not seen much of Roddy in the week that had elapsed since their visit . 0
A little , Elinor thought , as though he were playing a part in a play - the part of the devoted fiancE . -0.25
Then she had said to herself , Do n't be an idiot . -4.5
" Elinor said , " I do mind so terribly for her . -10.5
" Elinor said thoughtfully , " It would be in the doctors ' hands , of course . 2.0
Elinor exclaimed as she came into the drawing - room , " Is she very bad ? " 0.0
Roddy was looking pale and apprehensive . -4.5
Dr Lord and Elinor went upstairs . 0
Elinor stood looking down on her , shocked by the drawn , twisted face . -3.0
A faint change came over her face as she recognized Elinor . -1.5
" Elinor ... " Elinor said quickly , " I 'm here , Aunt Laura . 0.25
Elinor guessed at the meaning . 0
Dr Lord and Elinor frowned helplessly . -6.0
Then Elinor got a word . 0
Elinor took her hand in hers and felt a feeble pressure from her fingers . -4.5
Dr Lord laid a hand on Elinor 's arm and drew her gently away out of the room . 1.0
Elinor had turned her head to look after Mary . 0
The color rose in Elinor 's cheeks . -3.0
Elinor said , " Poor darling . " 0
Elinor said , her lips set very straight , " I 've learned not - to show my feelings . 0
Elinor said , raising her delicate eyebrows and looking full at him , " The mask ? " 1.0
Dr Lord said , " The human face is , after all , nothing more nor less than a mask . 0.6666666666666666
Elinor said , " Poor darling . 0
He looked at her , Elinor thought , rather oddly as though - as though he was sorry for her . -5.85
Elinor said , " Aunt Laura is worried about - about certain business matters . " 0
Roddy asked , " Does she want to make a new will ? " 0.0
Elinor answered , " She did n't say so . " 0
" What did she - ? " 0
He stopped in the middle of the question . 0
Elinor said in a harsh voice , " Yes ? 0
Elinor 's hands closed . 0
" Roddy said in alarm , " And have dinner with me ? 0
" Elinor said coldly , " They wo n't bite you ! 0.0
" " But what about you ? 0
" Elinor said , " No , the other way 's better . 0
" She said impatiently , " Oh , do let me arrange things my own way ! 0
" Chapter 4 It was no mere housemaid who wakened Elinor the following morning . " 0.0
Oh , Miss Elinor , she 's gone . 0
" " What ? 0
" Elinor sat up in bed . 0
Dead ? 0
" Elinor stared . " 0
Elinor said slowly , " So Aunt Laura died in her sleep - quite peacefully . " 2.5500000000000003
Elinor said rather sharply , " It was n't exactly sudden . " 0
Elinor said mechanically , " I did n't know you 'd seen her ? " 0
He nodded rather shamefacedly . 0
" The truth is , Elinor , I felt the most awful coward , because I 'd funked it ! " -7.0
Elinor nodded . 0
" Elinor said in a low voice , " Yes , it is . 0
" Elinor said , " But surely , after her first stroke - ? 0
" Mr Seddon shook his head . " 0
Elinor said in a puzzled voice , " But she wanted to die . " 0
Elinor said slowly , " So that 's why she was so upset last night - and in such a panic that you should be sent for . " 1.1999999999999993
Elinor said slowly , " All to me ? " 0
" The Crown takes a certain percentage , " Mr Seddon explained . 0
" Elinor said , " But Roderick - " Mr Seddon said with a little apologetic cough , " Mr Welman is only Mrs Welman 's husband 's nephew . 0.0
Elinor said slowly , " Of course , it does n't much matter which of us gets it , as we 're going to be married . -0.75
Elinor said . 0
For heaven 's sake , Elinor , do n't get it into your head that I grudge it to you . 0.0
Elinor said , her voice slightly unsteady , " We did agree , Roddy , in London that it would n't matter which of us it was , as - as we were going to be married ? " 0
He did n't answer . 0
Elinor said with a sudden gallant lift of the head , " It does n't matter - if we 're going to be married ... He went on : " Of course , Elinor , if you 've other ideas now - " Elinor cried out , " Oh , Roddy , ca n't you be honest ? 3.0
" Elinor said in a stifled voice , " I do . 0
" Elinor , her face white , said , " It 's not that . 0
" Elinor said , her mouth twisting sideways in a crooked smile , " It was n't difficult . 0.0
" Oh , Elinor - I do n't know what 's the matter ! " 0
Elinor said , " Yes , I can . 0
Oh , Elinor , what a cad I am , talking like this to you - " Elinor said , " Nonsense . 0
I 'm so terribly fond of you , Elinor ! 7.2
" Elinor said gently , " Love - is n't very reasonable . -4.199999999999999
" Roddy said miserably , " No . 0
" Elinor said , and her voice trembled a little , " Have you said anything to her ? 0.0
" Roddy said , " This morning - like a fool - I lost my head - " Elinor said , " Yes ? 0
" Roddy said , " Of course she shut me up at once ! 0
Taking it , he murmured without looking at her , " Elinor , you 've no idea what a beast I feel . " -1.5
Elinor said in her calm voice , " Do you think she 'll marry you ? " 0
He shook his head . 0
" Elinor said , " I think you 're right . 1.0
" You know , Elinor , I do love you - just as much as ever ! " 7.0
Elinor said , " If Mary was n't there - " Roddy said with sudden feeling , " Sometimes I wish she was n't ... You and I , Elinor , belong . " 0
You wanted to see me , Miss Elinor ? 0
" she said . 0
Elinor looked up . 0
Elinor held one hand shielding her face a little . -0.16666666666666666
" Elinor went on , her voice cold and detached : " My aunt , if she had had time to make a will , would have wished , I know , to leave several legacies . -1.5
Elinor said , " Though it was difficult for my aunt to speak coherently , she was able to make her meaning understood that last evening . " 3.0
Elinor said brusquely , " As soon as probate is granted , I am arranging that two thousand pounds should be made over to you - that sum to be yours to do with absolutely as you please . 0
Oh , Miss Elinor , that is good of you ! 2.0
" Elinor said sharply , " It is n't particularly good of me , and please do n't say anything . -0.14999999999999947
Elinor said , " I 'm glad . " 2.0
Elinor said , " That sounds a very good idea . " 0.72
" You 're very , very good , Miss Elinor , " said Mary gratefully . 2.6
Elinor said curtly , " It was Aunt Laura 's wish . " -1.5
She got up , said quietly , " Thank you very much , Miss Elinor , " and left the room . 1.0
Elinor sat quite still , staring ahead of her . 0
Elinor went at last in search of Roddy . 0
He turned sharply as Elinor came in . -0.5
You 've always got excellent judgment , Elinor . 5.0
Elinor held her breath for a minute , then she began to speak with nervous haste , the words tumbling out incoherently : " There 's something more . -1.5
He said , " My God , Elinor , do you want to make me feel an utter cad ? 0
Elinor cried out , " Roddy ! " 0
" Elinor said gently , " Poor Roddy . 2.0
Elinor drew herself up ; she flung back her head . 0
" Of course , Elinor . " 0
" And what is your advice ? " 0
Elinor said calmly , " You are not particularly tied ? " 0
Elinor , you 're wonderful ! 10.0
Oh , Elinor , my dear , you do n't know how truly fond I am of you . 4.3
" " Miss Elinor said that the night Mrs Welman died she told her to do something for me . -0.5
Elinor said , " What are you doing so busily ? 0
Suddenly Elinor laughed a strange laugh - almost hysterical . 0.25
What 's come to her ? 0
" Elinor had not taken more than half a dozen steps - she was still laughing - when a hand fell on her arm from behind . 1.0
He said peremptorily , " What were you laughing at ? " 0
Elinor said , " Really - I do n't know . 0
Elinor flushed . 0
That made me laugh ; I do n't know why ! 0.6666666666666666
" Lord said abruptly , " Do n't you ? 0
" Elinor said , " It was silly of me - I tell you - I 'm nervous . -2.25
" Elinor said incisively , " How useful ! 2.0
" He grinned disarmingly . 0
Elinor said , " There 's nothing the matter with me . " 0
Elinor said , " I 've had a certain amount of nervous strain I suppose . " -3.5
He said , " I expect you 've had quite a lot . " 0
Elinor shook her head . 0
" Elinor said , " I must be getting home now . 0
Elinor said impatiently , " It just struck me as funny , that was all ! " -3.0
" That Mary Gerrard was making a will ? 0
Elinor said impatiently , " Of course - everyone should make a will . " -3.0
Elinor said with feeling , " Yes , indeed . 0
Have you ? 0
" Elinor stared at him for a minute , then she laughed . " 0.5
In the library Elinor had just finished a letter : Dear Mr Seddon , Will you draft a will for me to sign ? 1.0
" Elinor said , " Do you mind its being sold ? 0
" " Oh , no , no ! 0
Elinor picked up her letter , glanced through it to see if it was all right . 0.5
Miss Elinor writes me that the house is sold and that she would like the lodge cleared out as soon as possible . 0
" Elinor shook her head . 0
And the cooking , they say , is fair , but it 's hardly what you 're accustomed to , Miss Elinor . -2.0
" Elinor said , smiling , " I 'm really quite comfortable . 2.6
" Elinor said , " I 'm glad someone has bought the house who really wants to live in it . 1.0
" Elinor said , " Yes , but , you see , it would have been a very large house for me to live in - alone . 0
Elinor said quickly , " I meant to ask you : Is there any special piece of furniture that you might care to have ? 0.3333333333333333
She said graciously , " Well , Miss Elinor , that is very thoughtful of you - very kind , I 'm sure . 7.3

And Marlene Tucker saw him Then she 's covered her own absence from the fete and we 've got her testimony , our only reliable testimony on the face of it , that Marlene Tucker was alive at a quarter past four . 1.0
We can summarise it as follows : we 've got five or six people who could have killed Marlene Tucker . 0
On the whole , though , it seemed unlikely that there was a sex angle to Marlene Tucker 's death . -1.5

Amongst them she suggested that Marlene might have a knowledge of somebody 's secret love affair , or that Marlene might have witnessed somebody being murdered , or that she knew where a buried treasure was hidden , or that she might have seen from the window of the boathouse some action performed by De Sousa in his launch as he was going up the river . 0
It 's possible , for instance , that Marlene , for some reason , came out of the boathouse . 1.0

She slipped through the woods , called to Marlene to let her in , and strangled the unsuspecting girl then and there . -6.0
The death of Marlene had been a bad shock to you - you had not had the least idea of what was planned ; but you revealed very clearly , though I was dense enough not to see it at the time , that when you talked of ' Hattie , ' you were talking of two different people - one a woman you disliked who would be ' better dead , ' and against whom you warned me ' not to believe a word she said ' - the other a girl of whom you spoke in the past tense , and whom you defended with a warm affection . -14.75

He displayed all the signs of high nervous tension on that evening at Crow 's Nest - he had a somewhat distorted view of life owing to his private troubles - he had a strong inferiority complex , which is a frequent cause of crime , he was at an unbalanced age , he had actually had a quarrel , or shall we say had displayed animosity against Mr. Babbington . -19.3

Ellis ( that 's the butler ) went to his room as usual and was missing in the morning . 1.0
We 've had reports that our man Ellis has been seen at Durham , at Ipswich , at Balham , at Land 's End , and a dozen other places . 0
Ellis obtains this post with false credentials . 1.0
What is Ellis 's position ? 0
" Mr. Ellis , now - that 's different . 0
I do n't know anything about Mr. Ellis , and could n't answer for him in any way , he having been brought from London , and strange to the place , while Mr. Baker was on holiday . " -3.0
" Baker ? " 0
asked Mr. Satterthwaite . 0
If Ellis turned out to be the criminal , well , Mrs. Leckie would have noticed something . 0
Mr. Ellis naturally was n't so upset as we were , he being new , but he behaved very considerate , and insisted on Beatrice and me taking a little glass of port to counteract the shock . 2.299999999999999
She 's a big dressmaker in London , so Mr. Ellis told us . " 1.0
I even heard him make a joke with Mr. Ellis , a thing he 'd never done with Mr. Baker . 1.0
Mr. Ellis had come up with a telephone message , and Sir Bartholomew asked him if he was sure he 'd got the names right , and Mr. Ellis said quite sure - speaking respectful , of course . 2.55
And the doctor he laughed and said , ' You 're a good fellow , Ellis , a first - class butler . 5.0
" And Ellis ? " 0
" He looked kind of disapproving , sir , as though it was the kind of thing he had n't been used to . 2.0
She herself did n't believe Mr. Ellis had anything to do with it . 0
" The wine glasses were taken out on a tray ? " 0
" Yes , sir , I held the tray and Mr. Ellis put the glasses on it , and I carried the tray out to the pantry , and there they were , sir , when the police came to examine them . 0
But I 've never seen any opening to it in the house . " 0
" Ellis never said anything about it ? " 0
" Oh , no , sir , he would n't know anything about it , I 'm sure . " 0.3333333333333333
He had been about to say that if Ellis was a professional criminal who had been detected by Sir Bartholomew and had murdered him in consequence the whole affair would become unbearably dull . -3.0
" I should say Ellis had n't used this at all . " 0
" Except - well , I think we are entitled to assume from the clipping we found that Ellis suffered from corns . " -3.0
Just after Ellis had brought him a telephone message . 0
That would explain his jubilation , it might explain his asking Ellis if he was sure of the name - he himself knowing well there was no such person , really . 5.25
Ellis lost his temper , said , ' Damn the thing , ' and hurled it across the room . " -4.5
So good had the performance been that he was left with the impression that so and only so could Ellis have acted . 3.0999999999999996
The police are looking for Ellis . 0
I say , Satterthwaite , where do you think Ellis is now ? " 0
" I presume , " said Mr. Satterthwaite , " that he got what he wanted . 0
You see , it stands to reason that if Ellis was n't the murderer , he must have disappeared for some reason or other , and it 's been in the back of my mind all along that blackmail might have been his line of business . " -4.5
" Presumably Ellis was paid to hold his tongue and his escape was facilitated . " 2.0
Ellis is dead . " -4.5
Ellis is the third murder . " -1.5
The murderer might have given Ellis the money and shown him the way to get out of the house gone down the passage with him and killed him there . 0
The idea that Ellis might be dead had come to him then ... Mr. Satterthwaite thought : " If Ellis is dead , then we 're dealing with a very dangerous person ... The police are trying hard to track down that man Ellis . -8.399999999999999
Where is Ellis ? 0
" A very mysterious person , Ellis . 0
Why was Ellis so successful ? 0
Because Ellis did not really exist . 0
Ellis , again , was a thing of pasteboard and paint and stagecraft - Ellis was not real . -4.5
They questioned Ellis and the others . 0
" It did not occur to her that Ellis was Sir Charles . 0

Mrs. Oliver , I understand , is acquainted with my mother , who met her at a literary luncheon party . 0

" " I understand from my friend , Mrs. Oliver , that you wanted to know something specifically . 0.16666666666666666
You wanted to know , in fact - " " What you said you wanted to know , " said Mrs. Oliver , chipping in with some firmness , " was whether Celia 's father shot her mother and then himself or whether Celia 's mother shot her father and then herself . 0
I am so sorry , dear Mrs. Oliver , to have to run away so soon , but you know what it is . -1.7249999999999996

" Inspector Bland inferred correctly that it was the murder an not the success of the fete to which Sir George was referring . " 0.0
Bland nodded . 0
If anyone did have any ideas as to what had been going on , Bland thought , it would be P.C. Hoskins . 0
" Bland received this information in silence . -3.0
Bland said : " I do n't think there was anything - well , of that kind . " 0
Inspector Bland sighed as he thought to himself that it was not quite as easy as that . 0
" " Sergeant Cottrill will attend to that , " said Bland . " 0
" Was she fond of the boys ? " 0
Bland addressed this question to Constable Hoskins . 0
" " Maybe , " agreed Bland . " 0
" Excellent , " said Inspector Bland , with approval . 0
" Inspector Bland smiled faintly . " -0.5
Rather a boring way for the girl to spend the afternoon when she might have been at the fete , " suggested Inspector Bland . " 0

" " At a quarter past four , " said Bland , writing it down , " Marlene Tucker was alive and well . 0.5
" Bland sighed . " 0
You read of these things in the papers , but that it should happen to our Marlene - " " I 'm very , very sorry about it , " said Inspector Bland gently . " 1.0
Bland nodded . -1.5
Bland reflected that the local verdict seemed to be the comfortable and probably age - long one of attributing every tragic occurrence to unspecified foreigners . -2.5
" Inspector Bland cut short these general reflections and told Hoskins to fetch Mrs Oliver . " 0
" Well , what was it ? " 0
demanded Bland . 0
" And he was with you when you discovered the body , " said Bland . 0
P.O. Hoskins inquired with interest : " Who 's this Monsieur Poirot , sir ? " 1.0
" You 'd describe him probably as a scream , " said Inspector Bland . -3.0
" Think there 's anything in that , sir ? " 0
Inspector Bland did not hear the question . 0
But Inspector Bland 's mind was running on a different course . 0
" I do n't suppose , " said Bland , rising and holding out his hand , " that you remember me , M. Poirot . 0
Since you remember me , why should I not remember you ? 0
" It would be difficult , Bland thought , to forget Hercule Poirot , and this not entirely for complimentary reasons . 1.0
Bland looked puzzled . 0
" I 'm beginning to have some odd ideas about this case , " said Bland . 0
" " I know that already , " said Bland irritably . " -1.5
And find out when she was last seen and where , " Bland shouted after him . " 0
It is n't working anywhere yet , " said Bland , " but I 've just woken up to the fact that a lady who ought to be on the premises is n't on the premises ! 2.0
" Well , she ca n't have gone far , " said Bland . 0
" Inspector Bland replied irrelevantly : " It 's that woman ! -1.5
" Poirot smiled faintly . " 0
" H 'm , " said Inspector Bland . 0
" Chapter 9 Although he had none of Constable Hoskins 's ingrained prejudice against foreigners , Inspector Bland took an instant dislike to Etienne De Sousa . " 0
" Oh , well , " said Inspector Bland in a friendly manner , " we ca n't hope for too much . " 0
Inspector Bland stared at him . 0
" Choosing his words carefully , Inspector Bland said : " Have you any reason to believe , Mr De Sousa , that your cousin might have some reason for wishing to avoid you ? 1.0
" " Hattie wish to avoid me ? 0
" Really - has this anything to do with the murder of the girl in the boathouse , which I understand is the real matter with which you occupy yourself ? " 0
" It might have a connection , " said Inspector Bland . 0
Inspector Bland much preferred the rural wisdom of Hoskins to the smart know - all attitude of Frank Cottrell . 5.0
" Inspector Bland frowned . " -1.5
Bland sounded gently interested . 2.0
" Bland seized his opportunity . -2.0
Why should he ? 0
" " I 'm not suggesting that anything like that happened , " said Inspector Bland , " but you must realise , Sir George , that in looking for the murderer of Marlene Tucker the field is a more restricted one than one might think at first . 0
" " Then you see , " said Inspector Bland , " what that means ? 0
" " Well , that latter point covers pretty well everyone , does n't it ? 0
" " Very far from it , " said Inspector Bland . " 0
" I 'm only suggesting , " said Inspector Bland , " that there 's a great deal we do n't know as yet . " 4.0
" It does n't matter in what order I see them , " said Inspector Bland . 0
" Look here , Amanda , you 've got to ... " Inspector Bland realised that Sir George depended a great deal upon the efficient Miss Brewis . 3.25
Bland found the master of the house rather like a small boy . 0.5
Whilst waiting , Inspector Bland picked up the telephone , demanded to be put through to the police station at Helmmouth and made certain arrangements with them concerning the yacht Esperance . 0
" " Quite true , sir , " said Inspector Bland . 0
What 's happened ? 0
" Inspector Bland looked at him in surprise . " 0
Chapter 14 Inspector Bland sat in Helmmouth Police Station . 0
Inspector Bland poked at it with a cautious forefinger . -1.5
" " Yes , " said Bland , " they could throw it in from the boathouse , or they could throw it in off a yacht . 0
" Inspector Bland glanced at the clock . " 0
I would n't bank on it , " said Bland . " 0
" If it does n't , it 's going to be difficult , " said Bland . -1.5
" You 're certain in your own mind that she did go into the river ? " 0
" I do n't see what else it can be , " said Inspector Bland sombrely . -1.5
Inspector Bland spent the afternoon taking a trip in that well - known pleasure steamer , The Devon Belle . 4.0
Inspector Bland looked surreptitiously at his watch . 0
Inspector Bland came ashore at Gitcham with the other two hundred and thirty passengers and consumed a lobster tea with Devonshire cream and scones . 0
He said to himself as he did so , " So it could be done , and no one would notice ! " 0
III While Inspector Bland was doing his experiment on the Helm , Hercule Poirot was experimenting with a tent on the lawn at Nasse House . 0
" " So we have n't got much time , " said Inspector Bland gloomily . -3.0
Inspector Bland paused , then said , " And , of course , there 's Mrs Legge - " " What have we got on her ? " 0
" She was n't in the tea tent from four to half - past as she says she was , " said Inspector Bland slowly . -0.75
" " You 're so damned respectable , Bland , " said Major Merrall . " 1.0
" I suppose you 're hinting at one of these sex murders ? " 0
" I 'm only looking about for what I can find , sir , " said Inspector Bland with dignity . 2.0
" " Would she do that if she was guilty ? 0
" " She might , " said Inspector Bland slowly . " -1.5
" You know , Bland , " said Merrall , " you 've got something there . 0
But what 's her motive , if so ? 0
" " No motive for killing the girl , " said Bland ; " but I do think , you know , that she might have a motive for killing Lady Stubbs . 0
That is , of course , if she did it , " added Inspector Bland as an afterthought . 0
Inspector Bland , so Poirot thought , had made a very fair and unprejudiced survey of the case . 1.2
The odds , Inspector Bland pointed out , were strongly against her being alive . 0
" Of course , " said Bland , " the body might not have been washed up . -0.6000000000000001
Bland was perhaps thinking the same . 0
And , according to Bland , she had said to her husband : " He kills people . 0
He sounded so pleased that Inspector Bland felt quite surprised . 0
" " Why ? 0
" demanded Inspector Bland . 0
Only Bland 's quiet persistence had caused him to cancel his dinner appointment for that evening . -0.5
" I know , Bland , I know , " he said fretfully . 0
He 's what age ? 0
" Bland slid tactfully over the answer to this question which , in any case , he did not know . 0
I know what you 've always thought , Bland . 0
( Which I have always thought myself , " added Bland parenthetically , " to be a silver thing with chains , and bits and pieces hung on it that people 's grandmothers used to clip on their waistbands - and a good idea , too . 3.0

" Laura Welman said , " What 's the point of this story ? 0
" Peter Lord said , " The point is that one 's got an instinct to live . 0
Laura Welman , breathing deeply and stertorously , lay as though in a stupor . -4.5
" I really do n't know what Mrs Welman would do without her . " 0
So I said , ' Why , of course , Mrs Welman . 0
Mrs Welman has been wonderfully kind , giving me all that expensive schooling . 4.5
I 've tried to - to - explain what I feel to Mrs Welman , but - it 's difficult - she does n't seem to understand . -3.0
In my opinion , as I said , Mrs Welman owes it to you to help you get a start at making your living . 1.0
" Oh , you 're awake , Mrs Welman . 0
I 'd have - " Mrs Welman broke in , " No , that 's all right . 1.0
" " Oh , Mrs Welman , it 's you who have been good to me . 3.0
" Mrs Welman said softly , " They 're good children - very good children . 2.7
" Mrs Welman went on , talking perhaps more to herself than to the girl : " I always hoped they might marry . 0
" I - I 'm so glad , Mrs Welman . " 0
" Oh , Mrs Welman , of course - of course ! " 0
" Oh , no , Mrs Welman , Dr Lord says you may live for years . 0
He said , ' If you 'd left me all your money , Mrs Welman , that would be different , of course ! ' 0
" Mrs Welman said , " Hopkins ought to have more sense at her age . 0
" Mrs Welman said indulgently , " She 's not a bad sort , really , but all nurses annoy me ; they always will think that you 'd like ' a nice cup of tea ' at five in the morning ! -1.0
" " Mrs Welman said to her niece , " I 'm very glad , Elinor , about you and Roddy . " 1.2
Mrs Welman nodded approval . 0
She said in a sprightly manner , " Mrs Welman , here 's Doctor come to see you . " 0
Good morning , Mrs Welman , " he said . 0
Mrs Welman went on : " Elinor and my nephew have come to cheer me up . 1.0
It will do you a lot of good , I am sure , Mrs Welman . 1.75
Mrs Welman said with a twinkle , " Going through the usual bag of tricks , Doctor : pulse , respiration , temperature ? -0.5
What a thing , now , to be saying to the doctor ! 0
" Dr Lord said with a twinkle , " Mrs Welman sees through me , Nurse ! 0
All the same , Mrs Welman , I 've got to do my stuff , you know . 0
" Mrs Welman said with an abrupt change of subject , " How do you like it down here ? 0
" Peter Lord said , smiling , " It suits me fine . 3.0
" " H 'm , " said Mrs Welman . " 0
Mrs Welman said , " My niece will want to speak to you , I expect . " 0
Mrs Welman was diverted . 0
Mrs Welman has been looking forward to you coming down . 1.0
She wants to lift Mrs Welman up , and she says you usually do it with her . 0
She 's been housekeeper at Hunterbury for years , ruling the roost and ordering everyone about , and now old Mrs Welman takes a fancy to you , and it puts her out ! -1.0
Mrs Welman spoke to me the other day . 0
Thinks , perhaps , Mrs Welman is a bit too fond of you , and resents it . -7.5
Mrs Welman said with a great effort , " You - all - you ... " Elinor said , " Yes , yes , leave it all to me . 4.0
Mrs Welman . 0
Mrs Welman may have thought she wanted to die , but side by side with that feeling there ran the hope that she would recover absolutely . 1.0
" Mrs Welman always meant to make a will , but tomorrow was always a better day to make it than today ! " 0.0
Since Mrs Welman died intestate , all her property goes to her next of kin - that is , to Miss Elinor Carlisle . -1.5
" Mrs Welman never meant that money for him . " 0
Dr Lord said , " Mrs Welman ought to have made a will . 0
So I said but surely Mrs Welman was a widow at the time , and she said . 0.5
His wife was lady 's maid to Mrs Welman before her marriage , I believe . 0
You can understand it 's been a bit of a blow , like - Mrs Welman dying , and then the place being sold off so quick - and I - well , the fact of the matter is I was going to get married this autumn , only one 's got to be sure - " He stopped . 2.55
Old Mrs Welman had made a lot of fuss about her , paid for her education , etc . -1.5
That damned District Nurse swears she lost a tube of morphine ! -6.0
" " When ? 0
" " Oh , weeks earlier , the night old Mrs Welman died . -1.25
They 're applying for an exhumation order and going to dig up old Mrs Welman . -0.375
But to the person guilty of the murder of Mrs Welman , imagine the effect of that remark ! -18.0
And her mother ? 0
" Nurse Hopkins hesitated , bit her lip , and then went on : " Her mother had been lady 's maid to old Mrs Welman . -0.30000000000000004
The death of Mrs Welman had been very sad . -5.1
And if I ventured to say a word , Mrs Welman was ready to bite my head off , though I 'd been with her nearly twenty years . -2.0
The old dame did n't like Mrs Welman taking such a fancy to Mary . -4.25
Was she fond of old Mrs Welman ? 0.0
" Ted Bigland said , " She 'd have been happy enough , I dare say , if Nurse had let her alone . 5.0
It will probably bring her censure for carelessness as it is , and if she poisoned Mrs Welman it was surely idiotic to draw attention to the morphine . -8.0
You could have given it to Mrs Welman ! 0
Do you also scout the possibility that she may have killed Mrs Welman out of compassion ? 0
" Roddy said , " I - I - no , I ca n't . 0
" As far as I know , none . " 0
" Did the late Mrs Welman , at any period of her life , make a will ? " -1.5
" Never . 0
He said cautiously , " As you say , Mrs Welman was much respected in Maidensford . 2.0999999999999996
You see , old Mrs Welman had made a lot of fuss over her . -0.9375
One of them was Mrs Welman , who had been a widow for some years and who was a woman capable of a deep and passionate love . 8.0
The way Mrs Welman looked at the girl , for one thing , and then hearing the gossip on top of it . 0
I was lady 's maid to Mrs Welman at Hunterbury , and very kind to me she was . 2.4
He was a fine gentleman and devoted to Mrs Welman . 1.0
If we lived on the place it would seem natural that Mrs Welman should be interested in the child and she 'd see to educating her and giving her a place in the world . 0
Mrs Welman gave us both a handsome sum of money ; but I would have helped her without that . 4.0
Everyone looked up to Mrs Welman in these parts ; there 's never been anything said against her . 0
Mrs Welman had had a stroke - the second . 0
" Well , no ... you see , we knew each other so well ... " " After the death of Mrs Welman , was there a slightly strained feeling between you ? " -0.75
" Yes , there was . " 0
I will underline yet another point : If Mrs Welman had lived twenty - four hours longer , she would have made a will ; and in all probability that will would have made a suitable provision for Mary Gerrard , but would not have left her the bulk of her fortune , since it was Mrs Welman 's belief that her unacknowledged daughter would be happier if she remained in another sphere of life . 2.0
Who could have administered that morphine to old Mrs Welman ? 0.0
But old Mrs Welman was not the kind of woman to allow herself to be blackmailed , and Nurse Riley , or Hopkins , very wisely , did not attempt anything of the sort . 3.3
Doubtless she made inquiries and discovered that Mrs Welman was a very wealthy woman , and some chance word of Mrs Welman 's may have revealed the fact that the old lady had not made a will . -0.13636363636363635
Mrs Welman must die intestate so that her illegitimate daughter would inherit her money . -4.5

So it 's a Girl Guide called Marlene Tucker . 0
And that the answers to them could not be her answers , since the victim was not the Yugoslavian first wife of an Atom Scientist , but Marlene Tucker , a fourteen - year - old village girl who , as far as was known , had not an enemy in the world . -4.5
What exactly is it that you want to know ? 0
" " I want to know all the details of this murder hunt first and of how this girl , Marlene Tucker , came to be taking a part in it . -1.5
" " And at quarter past four Marlene Tucker was alive and well ? 0
" " Yes , of course , " said Miss Brewis , " and very eager to know how people were getting on with the murder hunt , too . 1.65
" " It 's the murder of Marlene Tucker that we 're investigating , " said the inspector severely . -2.0
Do you think he killed Marlene Tucker ? 0
" " I think , " said the inspector gravely , " that Marlene Tucker saw something she was not meant to see . 0
I think that it was because of what Marlene Tucker saw that she had to be killed . 0
And Marlene Tucker saw him Then she 's covered her own absence from the fete and we 've got her testimony , our only reliable testimony on the face of it , that Marlene Tucker was alive at a quarter past four . 1.0
We can summarise it as follows : we 've got five or six people who could have killed Marlene Tucker . 0
On the whole , though , it seemed unlikely that there was a sex angle to Marlene Tucker 's death . -1.5
Marlene acknowledged the introduction with a pronounced snuffle . 0
Marlene giggled . 0
" In a murder I think you ought to have blood , " said Marlene sulkily . 0
" Any sex maniacs ? " 0
asked Marlene with avidity . 0
" " I like sex maniacs , " said Marlene with relish . -3.5
Let 's go and see how that Marlene child is getting on . 0
" We 've just come to cheer you up , Marlene , " she said brightly as she entered . 3.0
She felt slightly remorseful at her unjust suspicions of Marlene 's loyalty , for Marlene , artistically arranged as " the body , " was playing her part nobly , sprawled on the floor by the window . -1.5
Marlene made no response . 0
And Marlene did enjoy the idea of being the body . 3.0
" " How did you find Marlene when you arrived at the boathouse ? 0
Words with the teacher at school Marlene had now and again , and she 'd have her quarrels now and again with one of the girls or boys , but nothing serious in any way . -1.5
" " She never talked to you about anyone who might have been an enemy of any kind ? 0
" " She talked silly often , Marlene did , but nothing of that kind . -1.5
Why should anyone murder Marlene ? 0
And how would he know that Marlene was in the boathouse ? 0
Amongst them she suggested that Marlene might have a knowledge of somebody 's secret love affair , or that Marlene might have witnessed somebody being murdered , or that she knew where a buried treasure was hidden , or that she might have seen from the window of the boathouse some action performed by De Sousa in his launch as he was going up the river . 0
It 's possible , for instance , that Marlene , for some reason , came out of the boathouse . 1.0
There was just this poor child , Marlene , left and three younger children . -2.0
He turned them over and his expression was not unlike Inspector Eland 's had been as he noted the words Marlene had doodled down there before she died . -1.5
He remembered Marlene 's plain , rather spotty face . -4.2
He suspected that boys had not pinched Marlene at the pictures . -3.0
Frustrated , Marlene had got a vicarious thrill by her spying and peering at her young contemporaries . 4.0
Then of course she 'd have to kill Marlene too . 0
" " Who was it that actually suggested that Marlene should play the victim ? -1.5
" asked Poirot . 0
She did not even know Marlene . 0
And Marlene , I must say , was pleased enough at the idea . 1.0
Someone may have spoken to Marlene at the fete , or even before it . 0
Marlene would n't take presents from a stranger . 0
I wo n't have you putting that muck on your face , Marlene , I said . 0
" Did Mrs Legge give Marlene anything else ? " 0
he asked . 0
" " So Marlene was Merdell 's granddaughter , " said Poirot . " 0
Marlene did n't get that scarf off of the lady down at the cottage . 0
Hid it at the back of her drawer , Marlene did , under her winter vests . 0
" Tell me , how did Marlene get the money to buy these things ? " 0
" She used to snoop about a bit , Marlene did . 0
Marlene would promise not to tell and then they 'd give her a present , see ? 0
" Marlene 's phrases scrawled on the margin . 0
Do you remember telling me that there was a final clue written on one of the ' comics ' that Marlene was given to amuse her ? 0
" " You see , in Marlene 's haversack , which was supposed to be the Yugoslavian 's wife 's haversack , if you understand what I mean - " They arranged their plan so that Marlene should be killed and Lady Stubbs ' disappear ' in conditions which should throw vague suspicion on De Sousa . 0
She slipped through the woods , called to Marlene to let her in , and strangled the unsuspecting girl then and there . -6.0
The death of Marlene had been a bad shock to you - you had not had the least idea of what was planned ; but you revealed very clearly , though I was dense enough not to see it at the time , that when you talked of ' Hattie , ' you were talking of two different people - one a woman you disliked who would be ' better dead , ' and against whom you warned me ' not to believe a word she said ' - the other a girl of whom you spoke in the past tense , and whom you defended with a warm affection . -14.75

" Olga Seminoff . 0
It included one or two charities - not so many as before - the old servants had no legacies at all , and the whole residue of her considerable fortune was left to Olga Seminoff in gratitude for the devoted service and affection she had shown her . 7.9
He could be sorry , and was sorry , for Olga Seminoff though he was quite unaffected by the passionate arguments she advanced for herself . 0.75
But to cut out the relations altogether , the nephew who had been his aunt 's residuary legatee in the last four wills she had made during a period of nearly twenty years , to leave everything to the stranger Olga Seminoff - that was not in Louise Llewellyn - Smythe 's character . 0
And Miss Olga Seminoff seems to have been last heard of returning to Czechoslovakia , or wherever she came from . 0
Before the time that those two , Olga Seminoff and Lesley Ferrier , met secretly without Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe knowing about it . " 0
Olga Seminoff had not returned to her home town . 0
It was not necessary for Olga Seminoff to be accused of forgery , or prosecuted . -6.0
So on a suitable occasion Olga Seminoff died . -0.5
Her name , I believe , was Olga or Sonia -1 am not sure of the surname . " -4.5
Olga , her last venture , seems to have suited her very well . 2.2
She says ' Now , Olga , ' she says . 0
Yes , what Olga was telling him now was certainly true , and because it was true it was one of the reasons why the codicil appended to the last Will properly drawn out and signed by Louise Llewellyn - Smythe had been accepted at first without suspicion . 3.0
If Olga had been less greedy , Mr Fullerton thought , if she had been content to write a codicil beginning as this one had done . 2.0
And that had opened up a vista for Olga . 0
" Everyone is against me , " said Olga . 0
And she turns to this foreign girl - Miss Olga we all called her - and said ' You go out of the room now , dear , because you must n't be mixed up in this part of it , ' or something like that . -1.5
So Miss Olga , she goes out of the room and Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe , she tells us to come close and she says ' This is my Will , this is . ' 0
" Well , it said something like , as far as I remember - the exact words I 'm not quite sure of - something about a codicil and that after the legacies mentioned in her Will , she bequeathed her entire fortune to Olga - I 'm not sure of the surname , it began with an S. Seminoff , or something like that - in consideration of her great kindness and attention to her during her illness . -6.35
Mind you , I was n't particularly fond of Miss Olga myself . -2.0999999999999996
It did n't come to court at all and as far as anyone knew , Miss Olga ran away . 0
Everything was all right , there was n't any question of that Miss Olga getting away with the money , so I did n't see as it was any call for me - " " But now you feel differently ? " 0
" It 's that nasty death - that child that was pushed into a bucket of apples . -9.0
All this trouble coming along and if that Miss Olga did it , murdered Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe , I mean , and young Joyce saw her do it ... She was ever so cock - a-hoop about it all , Miss Olga was , I mean about hearing from the lawyers as she 'd come into a lot of money . -5.0
" Like the girl Olga did . " 0
" As you say , like the girl Olga did . " 0
" Was Lesley a friend of Olga 's ? " 0

I do n't know what he saw in Olga - she was n't very beautiful . 0.7999999999999998
I did come across them fairly frequently but Olga never confided in me . 0
" There seems a likelihood of it , does there not ? " 0
" Olga was supposed to have been able to copy Mrs Llewellyn - Smythe 's handwriting fairly well , but it seemed to me always that that was rather a doubtful point . -1.5
The last letters received from Olga had been dated about a year and a half ago . 0
When no more letters came , the elderly friend assumed that Olga had married her Englishman and changed her address . 2.0
Lesley had been given money by someone , Olga perhaps ( money originally given her by her employers ) , to induce him to do forgery on her behalf . -1.5
" Then if he knew there was a real codicil why did n't he marry Olga and get hold of the money that way ? " 0
" Because he doubted whether she really would get the money . 0
Besides , I doubt if Olga could have put through the purchase of a Greek island - or would even have been willing to do so . 0
Olga had to be removed because she knew about the codicil - and she was also to be the scapegoat , branded as a forger . -3.0
I knew that Olga 's body must be hidden somewhere in this neighbourhood , but I had no idea where until I heard Miranda one day inquiring about a wishing well , urging Michael Garfield to take her there . 0
