I/PRP met/VBD Mr./NNP Bland/JJ as/IN I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG along/IN the/DT crescent/NN towards/IN Albany/NNP Road/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Bland/JJ seemed/VBD in/IN very/RB good/JJ form/NN ./.
Bland/JJ was/VBD a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN local/JJ builder/NN ,/, McNaughton/NNP had/VBD had/VBN a/DT Chair/NN at/IN Cambridge/NNP ,/, Mrs./NNP Hemming/NNP was/VBD the/DT widow/NN of/IN a/DT local/JJ auctioneer/NN ,/, the/DT Waterhouses/NNPS were/VBD respectable/JJ residents/NNS of/IN long/JJ standing/NN ./.

The/DT letter/NN is/VBZ addressed/VBN to/IN Mrs./NNP Bland/JJ and/CC the/DT only/JJ difficulty/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Mrs./NNP Bland/JJ who/WP receives/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT wrong/JJ Mrs./NNP Bland/JJ --/HYPH she/PRP is/VBZ the/DT second/JJ wife/NN --/: not/RB the/DT first/JJ one/CD --/HYPH Imagine/VB the/DT chagrin/NN !/.

Nobody/NN in/IN Crowdean/NNP knows/VBZ that/IN Bland/JJ was/VBD married/VBN before/RB ./.
I/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN someone/NN was/VBD coming/VBG over/RB from/IN Canada/NNP to/IN this/DT country/NN --/, and/CC that/IN this/DT someone/NN had/VBD known/VBN the/DT first/JJ Mrs./NNP Bland/JJ well/RB enough/RB not/RB to/TO be/VB deceived/VBN by/IN an/DT impersonation/NN ./.

"/`` Mrs./NNP Bland/JJ did/VBD remind/VB me/PRP of/IN someone/NN when/WRB I/PRP saw/VBD her/PRP ,/, "/'' said/VBD Hardcastle/NNP ./.
