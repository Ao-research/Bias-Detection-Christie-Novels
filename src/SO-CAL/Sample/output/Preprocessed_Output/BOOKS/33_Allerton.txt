In/IN the/DT drawing/NN room/NN before/IN we/PRP went/VBD in/IN to/IN dinner/NN I/PRP was/VBD introduced/VBN to/IN Miss/NNP Cole/NNP and/CC Major/NNP Allerton/NNP ./.
Major/JJ Allerton/NNP I/PRP instinctively/RB disliked/VBD ./.
Allerton/NNP 's/POS success/NN was/VBD with/IN the/DT women/NNS of/IN the/DT party/NN ./.
Major/JJ Allerton/NNP now/RB ./.
If/IN Allerton/NNP was/VBD X/NN ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD ,/, his/PRP$ crimes/NNS had/VBD been/VBN committed/VBN for/IN profit/NN in/IN some/DT way/NN ./.
Allerton/NNP was/VBD coining/VBG along/IN the/DT corridor/NN towards/IN me/PRP ./.
For/IN it/PRP came/VBD to/IN me/PRP very/RB strongly/RB that/IN Allerton/NNP was/VBD almost/RB certainly/RB X/NN ./.
She/PRP was/VBD ,/, I/PRP knew/VBD ,/, a/DT level/NN -/HYPH headed/VBN girl/NN ,/, well/RB able/JJ to/TO take/VB care/NN of/IN herself/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB think/VB that/IN she/PRP would/MD really/RB be/VB taken/VBN in/RP by/IN the/DT cheap/JJ attraction/NN of/IN a/DT man/NN like/IN Allerton/NNP ./.
"/`` A/DT parental/JJ warning/NN against/IN the/DT big/JJ bad/JJ wolf/NN ?/. "/''
"/`` No/UH ,/, no/UH ,/, Judith/NNP ,/, of/IN course/NN not/RB ./. "/''
"/`` I/PRP gather/VBP you/PRP do/VB n't/RB like/VB Major/JJ Allerton/NNP ?/. "/''
"/`` Frankly/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ./.
I/PRP considered/VBD Allerton/NNP next/RB ./.
Could/MD there/RB be/VB any/DT reason/NN for/IN doing/VBG away/RB with/IN Allerton/NNP ?/.
If/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO have/VB a/DT murder/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB to/TO see/VB Allerton/NNP the/DT victim/NN !/.
She/PRP might/MD ,/, conceivably/RB ,/, be/VB actuated/VBN by/IN jealousy/NN if/IN she/PRP and/CC Allerton/NNP had/VBD ever/RB been/VBN on/IN intimate/JJ terms/NNS ,/, though/IN I/PRP had/VBD no/DT reason/NN to/TO believe/VB that/IN that/DT was/VBD the/DT case/NN ./.
Besides/RB ,/, if/IN Allerton/NNP was/VBD X/NN -/HYPH I/PRP shook/VBD my/PRP$ head/NN impatiently/RB ./.
Allerton/NNP 's/POS manner/NN was/VBD outrageous/JJ ./.
"/`` Well/UH ,/, you/PRP could/MD n't/RB say/VB it/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT blessed/JJ release/NN ,/, could/MD you/PRP ?/. "/''

"/`` Where/WRB had/VBD you/PRP been/VBN yesterday/NN evening/NN when/WRB I/PRP met/VBD you/PRP ,/, you/PRP and/CC Major/NNP Allerton/NNP ?/. "/''
It/PRP was/VBD Allerton/NNP But/CC I/PRP 'd/MD just/RB like/VB to/TO say/VB that/IN if/IN I/PRP 'd/VBD spent/VBN the/DT whole/JJ day/NN walking/VBG around/RB with/IN Major/JJ Allerton/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB not/RB your/PRP$ business/NN ./.
Allerton/NNP ,/, I/PRP knew/VBD ,/, was/VBD a/DT real/JJ bad/JJ lot/NN ./.
If/IN Allerton/NNP were/VBD X/NN -/HYPH ?/.

A/DT chance/NN word/NN spoken/VBN one/CD day/NN revealed/VBD to/IN me/PRP the/DT fact/NN that/IN Allerton/NNP was/VBD a/DT married/JJ man/NN ./.
Allerton/NNP 's/POS wife/NN was/VBD a/DT devout/JJ Roman/NNP Catholic/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD Allerton/NNP 's/POS voice/NN I/PRP heard/VBD ./.
Allerton/NNP was/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO meet/VB Judith/NNP in/IN London/NNP tomorrow/NN ./.

"/`` I/PRP should/MD n't/RB have/VB been/VBN caught/VBN ,/, "/'' I/PRP said/VBD ./.
"/`` Yes/UH ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB everyone/NN who/WP has/VBZ a/DT daughter/NN whom/WP Allerton/NNP is/VBZ pursuing/VBG with/IN dishonourable/JJ intentions/NNS -/, to/TO use/VB an/DT old/JJ -/HYPH fashioned/JJ melodramatic/JJ phrase/NN ./.
I/PRP remembered/VBD a/DT day/NN on/IN a/DT grassy/JJ knoll/NN and/CC Norton/NN swinging/NN up/IN his/PRP$ glasses/NNS to/TO see/VB a/DT speckled/JJ woodpecker/NN ,/, I/PRP remembered/VBD his/PRP$ immediate/JJ distress/NN and/CC embarrassment/NN ,/, his/PRP$ endeavours/NNS to/TO prevent/VB me/PRP from/IN looking/VBG through/IN the/DT glasses/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ turn/NN ,/, At/IN the/DT moment/NN I/PRP had/VBD leaped/VBN to/IN the/DT conclusion/NN that/IN what/WP he/PRP had/VBD seen/VBN was/VBD something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN me/PRP -/, in/IN fact/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD Allerton/NNP and/CC Judith/NNP ./.
I/PRP reflected/VBD ,/, as/IN I/PRP had/VBD reflected/VBN before/IN ,/, that/IN Allerton/NNP was/VBD certainly/RB cast/VBN for/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT villain/NN ./.

Allerton/NNP is/VBZ the/DT type/NN of/IN man/NN you/PRP instinctively/RB dislike/VBP and/CC fear/VBP ./.
You/PRP saw/VBD Allerton/NNP and/CC Judith/NNP kiss/NN ./.
