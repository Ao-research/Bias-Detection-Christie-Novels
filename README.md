This study investigates character analysis and bias detection in Agatha Christie's detective novels, focusing on the depiction of social class and case identity in Polo's stories. Using quantitative methods, we identify and analyze adjectives associated with different social classes to uncover biases and stereotypes. Our approach involves sentiment analysis and statistical techniques to examine personas associated with different social groups. By analyzing the frequency and context of these adjectives, we aim to reveal patterns and differences in social class characteristics. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between social class and case identity by examining the proportions of victims and offenders in different social groups. Through these analysis, we attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the social attitudes and concepts conveyed in Agatha's detective novels.
